<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">7.3</span> <span class="title">Leaders</span>
</h2>
<div class="para" id="p-642">Sectional leadership expanded and broadened throughout the EPADEL period. Initially, the ten-member Executive Committee – three officers, the section governor, and six members elected at large – planned and implemented all of the section’s activities. Toward the end of the preceding period, the newsletter editor joined the committee ex-officio. Membership burgeoned after that. From 1982 through 1987 the SIG chairman became an ex-officio member. So did the public information officer in 1989. The next year, the coordinators of three programs also came aboard in the same capacity – student chapters, workshops and special events, and visiting lecturer and consultant program. Finally, beginning in 1994, the publisher’s liaison was added to the roll. The tradition of the newsletter editor, PIO, coordinator of student clubs, and publisher’s liaison serving as ex-officio members of the Executive Committee continues today. Although the by-laws permit voting only by elected officials, the Committee has found that over the years a consensus is reached, so formal votes are rarely taken.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-643">Another persisting tradition is that any officer of the national MAA or editor of an MAA journal becomes an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. In the present period, Doris Schattschneider served on the Executive Committee 1980-1985 for her role as editor of Mathematics Magazine and 1994-1996 as first vice president of the national MAA. Gerald Porter joined the Committee in 1989 when he was elected governor-at-large of the MAA. The next year he joined the MAA’s Finance Committee and three years later was elected treasurer of the national Association. Schattschneider was profiled in <a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">Chapter 6</a>; Porter is profiled in <a href="SpringMeetings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Spring Meetings, 1975-2000">Chapter 8</a>.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-644">
<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table21.html" title="Table 7.3.1: ">Table 7.3.1</a> lists the section’s officials who were elected from 1979 to 2000. Even though all positions of leadership remained the same as they had been since the dramatic revision of 1968, we now include section governors on the list since they began to assume leadership roles in the middle of the preceding period. Although we do not list members elected to three-year terms on the Executive Committee, we describe some of their efforts below.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-645">The header in  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table21.html" title="Table 7.3.1: ">Table 7.3.1</a> indicates a slight change in the titles of the section’s officers during the EPADEL period. At the business meeting held during the lunch hour at the spring meeting in April 1979, the section’s chair Doris Schattschneider “appointed Will Baxter and Herb Wilf to prepare changes in the Bylaws to make them ‘unisex’.” At the meeting in November 1979 the section’s membership voted to affect those changes; since then “president” replaced all former references to “chairperson”.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-646">Recall our convention that the year <span class="process-math">\(1999\)</span> in the penultimate row of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table21.html" title="Table 7.3.1: ">Table 7.3.1</a> refers to the November meeting at which Douglas Ensley (Shippensburg) was elected president of the section even though he carried out most of his duties in the year 2000.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-647">The section derived great benefits from a cadre of leaders during this <span class="process-math">\(22\)</span>-year period, including <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> different presidents, one additional vice-president, three additional secretary-treasurers, and four additional section governors. These 19 officers were affiliated with 15 different institutions, with only Drexel, Gettysburg, Moravian, and Wilkes being home to more than one office holder.  The officers represent a wide geographic area, ranging from Wilkes (Wong and Berard) in the north to Delaware (Baxter) in the south, and from Lehigh (King) in the east to Shippensburg (Ensley) in the west.</div>

</table></div></figure><div class="para" id="p-648"><i class="foreign">Presidents</i></div>
<div class="para" id="p-649">The section boasted 11 different presidents in the 22-year EPADEL period. Although the by-laws prohibit more than two consecutive terms, no president has served two nonconsecutive terms. This feature is clearly seen in  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table21.html" title="Table 7.3.1: ">Table 7.3.1</a>. Equally evident is the tradition of the vice-president serving a two-year term before ascending to a two-year presidency.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-650">The presidents represent a diverse lot in various respects. Walter Stromquist was only the second officer in the section’s 75-year history to hold a nonacademic affiliation. (Ed Block was first, in 1957-1958.) The 10 presidents with academic affiliation came from eight different schools. Howard Anton and Bernard Kolman continued the line of six different presidents from Drexel University that began with James E. Davis in 1942. Wilkes College was the only other institution to boast two different presidents in the EPADEL period; Bing Wong and Louise Berard are the only two officers (in any capacity) ever affiliated with Wilkes in the section’s history. Nancy Hagelgans was the third president to come from Ursinus College, having been preceded by John Clawson in 1935 and Frank Manning in 1951. Two presidents were the second to come from their home institution: Kay Somers (Moravian College) was preceded by Doris Schattschneider by 20 years, while David Hill (Temple University) was preceded by Walter Lawton by 30 years. The remaining three presidents were the only ones to ever represent their institution in this office: David Flesner (Gettysburg College), Marvin Brubaker (Messiah College), and Douglas Ensley (Shippensburg University.) Contrary to the section’s earlier history, no president in the EPADEL period came from the four institutions that produced the most presidents up to 1979: the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Delaware.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-651">Unlike the period 1956-1978, when 38% of the section’s chairs received their doctorates at Penn, in the present period only Bernard Kolman did (9%). Similarly, whereas 77% of the chairs received their doctorate from Ivy League institutions in the earlier period, only three (Stromquist, Berard, and Kolman) of the 11 did so in the present period (27%).</div>
<div class="para" id="p-652">Before proceeding we pause to emphasize a point made in <a href="Emigres.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Émigrés, 1933-1941">Chapter 4</a>: the last decade of the <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>th century was a period of female leadership of the section.  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table21.html" title="Table 7.3.1: ">Table 7.3.1</a> reveals that Nancy Hagelgans, Louise Berard, and Kay Somers held office in six of the 10 years.

His doctoral dissertation on dynamical systems was written under Waldemar Trjitzinsky. Wong held assistant professorships at two institutions before arriving at Wilkes College (now Wilkes University) in 1968 as a professor.

His dissertation – on maximal subgroups of four-dimensional symplectic groups in characteristic two – was written under Jack E. McLaughlin. Upon receiving his doctorate, Flesner came to Gettysburg College and has remained there ever since. He became chair of the department in 1999. His book Aging and the Aged: Problems, Opportunities, Challenges (edited with Edwin D. Freed) was published in 1980. For several years after that he directed an interdepartmental senior honors Seminar on Aging and the Aged.

From 1957 to 1964 he was a principal mathematician at the UNIVAC Division of Sperry Rand Corporation. Meanwhile he completed his doctoral studies at Penn, and received his Ph.D. in 1965 for a dissertation on the lattice of subalgebras of a Lie algebra written under Morikuni Goto. Kolman had accepted an assistant professorship at Drexel in 1964, and he remained there 34 years until his retirement in 1998, having served as department head 1971-1972. During that tenure he organized two well-known conferences in Lie algebras and edited the proceedings from them. He also directed one Ph.D. student.

He spent the year 1966-1967 as a computer analyst with Koppers Corp. in Pittsburgh before entering the graduate program at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received his Ph.D. in 1973. His dissertation on numerical solutions of delay differential equations was written under the supervision of George D. Byrne. Hill joined the faculty at Pittsburgh as an associate instructor during the last two years of graduate school. Upon receiving his doctorate he accepted an assistant professorship at Temple University, where he has been since, except for a visiting position at the College of the Virgin Islands in 1980. During his tenure he directed two masters theses. Hill has been a principal investigator on three major grants – two from the NSF (one with D. Zitarelli established linear algebra as a lab course in 1990) and one from FIPSE (to produce an interactive text for linear algebra with G. Porter). In 1988 Hill presented a mini-course on MATLAB at the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-178" id="fn-178"><sup> 1 </sup></a> summer meeting in Providence, R.I, and in 1995 he delivered a one-hour invited address at the annual MAA meeting on teaching linear algebra with technology. In addition to talks at the EPADEL spring meetings in 1986 and 1995, he has been an invited lecturer in Holland, England, and the Czech Republic. He also taught a short course at Messiah College sponsored by EPADEL in 1990. His expertise in teaching with computers led him to conduct numerous workshops – at the Northeastern Section of the MAA in 1994, the MAA MathFest in Seattle in 1996, and the NSF-sponsored ATLAST Project from 1992 through 1996. Hill is the author of several successful textbooks, including three with Bernard Kolman. In addition, he was the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching Award at Temple in 1996.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Nancy Lineken Hagelgans</dfn> was born in Burlington, Vermont. She received an A.B. from Goucher College in 1956 before entering the graduate program at Johns Hopkins, earning an M.A. three years later. Hagelgans taught at two Baltimore institutions (Goucher 1967-1968 and Towson State 1967- 1972) before moving to the EPADEL area. While teaching at Haverford from 1975 to 1977 she decided to complete her doctorate at Hopkins. Her supervisor, Jean-Pierre Meyer, suggested that James Stasheff of Temple might act as her advisor. He did, and Hagelgans completed her dissertation on local spaces with three cells as H-spaces in 1977. She spent 1977-1978 at Bryn Mawr, all the while searching for a tenure-track position. Since it seemed that the only openings involved computer science she completed an M.S. in that field at Villanova in 1979. In 1978 Hagelgans landed a tenure- track position at Ursinus in both mathematics and computer science. She has remained there ever since, except for the year 1986-1987 spent as a visiting professor at the University of Delaware. She served as the department chair at Ursinus 1988-1992 and resumed that post in January 2001. Hagelgans was elected to a three-year term on the EPADEL Executive Committee in 1986, when she also began coordinating the Consultants and Speakers Program. In addition to four years as president and vice president, she was elected to a three-year term as governor 1995-1998. She also was an invited speaker at the section’s spring meeting in 1996 on one of her specialties, cooperative learning in discrete mathematics. Along this line, she is one of the authors of the book <span class="booktitle">A Practical Guide to Cooperative Learning in Collegiate Mathematics</span>, published in 1995 as MAA Notes Number 37. Hagelgans has been active in the national MAA in many other ways – serving on the Committee on Consultants (1997-1999), the task force on the MAA publication <span class="booktitle">Guidelines for Programs and Departments in Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences</span> (1997-2000), the Professional Development Committee (1998-2001), and the Committee on Sections (1999-2002). She has also been involved in Project NexT as a mentor since 1995, as a workshop presenter in 1996, and as a panelist in 1998 and 1999.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Walter Rees Stromquist</dfn> possesses very strong mathematical genes. His father, Walter Kellogg Stromquist (1917-1999), was a nuclear engineer with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Tennessee. WKS worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory when his son WRS was born. WKS’s uncle, Carl Eben Stromquist (1877-1925), received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale in 1903 and was on the faculty at Princeton 1903-1909. CES then moved to the University of Wyoming, where he remained until ill health forced him to resign in 1922. During this time he was a charter member of the MAA in 1915 and one of the organizing members of the Rocky Mountain Section of the MAA two years later. EPADEL chair Walter Rees Stromquist received his B.A. from the University of Kansas in 1970 before enrolling in the graduate program at Harvard, where he earned two degrees – an M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1975. His dissertation on the four-color problem was written under the supervision of Andrew Gleason. Stromquist did not restrict himself to mathematics during his stay at Harvard, however, electing graduate courses in economics and tax law. Thus it is not particularly surprising that his first professional experience was with the Office of Tax Analysis in the U.S. Treasury, where he worked 1973-1977. In 1979 Stromquist accepted a position with Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, ultimately rising to become vice president of the company before leaving in 1998 to become an independent consultant. During his tenure he was a visiting professor at Temple 1987-1988; he also taught as an adjunct professor at Bryn Mawr, Eastern College (in economics), George Washington, and West Point (as an Army reservist). Stromquist served as a member of the section’s Executive Committee 1987-1991 before being elected to stints as vice president and president. At the national level, Stromquist was elected MAA Governor at Large for Industry and Government in 2000 and served as an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> <span class="process-math">\(1996-2001\text{.}\)</span>

Upon receiving his degree, Ensley moved to Shippensburg, where he became a 1993 project NExT fellow. He served as assistant chair at Shippensburg 1995-1999. Summers found him back in Pittsburgh, however, as the mathematics instructor for the Pennsylvania Governor’s School of the Sciences (PGSS) held at Carnegie Mellon. His contributions were recognized by the PGSS with an Exemplary Service Award in 1996. In addition to serving EPADEL as president and vice president, Ensley volunteered in two other capacities, coordinating the Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program 1995-1999 and directing (with Joanne Darken) Project NExT 2000-2001. In his short career Ensley has also been active with the MAA, serving as a Visiting Mathematician during the fall of 2000. This led to his being appointed editor of the MAA Digital Classroom Resources, a part of the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library. Winning a graduate student teaching award at Carnegie Mellon in 1993 foreshadowed successful teaching at Shippensburg, as three of his students have won MAA awards for student paper presentations at two different Mathfests.</div></li>

<div class="para" id="p-657"><i class="foreign">Secretary-Treasurers</i></div>
<div class="para" id="p-658">During the EPADEL period the four individuals who served as secretary- treasurer of the section continued the long tradition of lengthy, dedicated service. Altogether, 17 different people have been elected secretary-treasurer in the 75- year history of the section. However, three of them served only one year, meaning that the remaining 14 secretary-treasurers served a total of 72 years in office. We have already met two of the four secretary-treasurers who served in the EPADEL period – Will Baxter and Kay Somers. The latter was the only female to hold this position in the 75-year history of the section.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-659">We provide sketches of the other two secretary-treasurers below, but first we note that both of them have been particularly effective in their role as treasurer. In 1983 the section received a letter from Alfred B. Willcox at the national MAA indicating that the remission of $120 to the national office by treasurer Jim Brooks was “extraordinary.” Willcox added, “Aid to sections is available ... If the fortunes of EPADEL should take a turn for the worse, you might keep this in mind.” Although the section’s finances continued to run in the black, the treasurer’s report to the Executive Committee at the meeting held September 1984 came with a caveat: “Our current bank balance is $578. We need to be careful about expenditures.” Subsequent treasurers carried on the tradition of careful expenditures, and in Cliff Wagner’s final account to the Executive Committee he reported a balance of over $13,000.</div>
