<chapter xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"  xml:id="WWII">
  <title>WW II and its Aftermath, <m>1942-1955</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Chapter 4 described many of the activities and dominant figures in the
      Philadelphia Section during the 1930s, up to the time of the U.S. entry into
      World War II. This chapter extends coverage to the 14-year period from
      1942 through 1955, examining activities that took place during the war and the
      decade afterwards. The year 1956 marked a watershed in the section’s history
      due to the formation of the New Jersey Section. Hence the period 1942-1955 was
      the last in which MAA members living in the Garden State were automatically
      associated with our section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin the chapter with a summary of the section’s annual meetings,
      highlighting contributions made by another set of sectional leaders. In addition to
      profiles of G. C. Webber, Anna Wheeler, and John Oxtoby at the end of the
      chapter, our chronicle contains biographical sketches of eight other chairs, three
      secretaries, three members of the Program Committee, and three speakers.
      Several notable events are reported, including the election of the first woman as
      chair of the section and the emerging leadership of members from the University
      of Delaware and Franklin &amp; Marshall College. This period also witnesses
      vigorous activity by mathematicians from Rutgers and Princeton. Perhaps the
      most decisive development for the governance of the section was the evolution of
      the Program Committee from a group of small size and limited charge to today’s
      expanded, proactive Executive Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last part of the chapter considers the 56 presentations made during this
      14-year period. Unlike earlier chapters, a chronological account precedes the
      customary analysis by mathematical classification. The lectures clearly reflect the
      influence of the Penn School of Analysis. They also reflect the emphasis placed
      on applications at meetings held during World War II and on educational issues
      at meetings held afterwards. One presentation in 1954 was particularly
      noteworthy, both because its format preceded the panel discussions that gained
      popularity afterwards and because it dealt with a new technology – television.

  <section>
    <title>Annual Meetings</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Table11">Table</xref> provides an overview of annual meetings in the period 1942-1955.
      The final column provides a reference (date of issue and page numbers) to the
      official annual reports as they appeared in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> for anyone desiring
      further information about the meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first column of <xref ref="Table11">Table</xref> lists the dates of the 14 meetings in this period. It
      is notable that the Philadelphia Section, unlike many others, was able to hold
      meetings every year throughout World War II. Even two national MAA meetings
      were canceled, the 1942 meeting scheduled for New York (<q>at the request of the
      Office of Defense Transport</q>) and the 1945 summer meeting scheduled for
      Montreal (<q>by order of the Office of Defense Transport</q>). Continuing the official
      policy from 1939, the section held its annual meetings on the Saturday following
      Thanksgiving.

The second column lists the sites of these 14 meetings. Clearly the University
of Pennsylvania dominated, hosting eight gatherings, including every one during
WW II. The twin institutions, Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College, hosted
postwar meetings in 1947 and 1949, respectively. (Bryn Mawr was always a
women’s college. Haverford was a men’s college until 1978, when women
transfer students were first admitted; the first fully coeducational class entered in
1980.) Consequently the 1950 meeting at Lehigh University marked the first time
the section met outside the Philadelphia area since Lehigh hosted the annual
affair in 1939. The site of the 1952 meeting – the University of Delaware –
marked the first time the section sponsored a meeting in the <q>First State</q>. This
location represents the culmination of activity by Delaware members that had
increased dramatically throughout the 1940s.
</p>
<p>
The section met in New Jersey for the last time in 1954. The meeting hosted
by Princeton University is noteworthy for another reason – attendance exceeded
100 for the first time in the section’s history. The Philadelphia Section sponsored
no more meetings in New Jersey after 1955 due to the formation of two other
MAA sections. In 1941 the Metropolitan New York Section had been carved out
of the existing Upper New York State Section, with boundaries including the part
of New Jersey north of New Brunswick. However, by the mid-1950s two
developments prompted the desire for a New Jersey Section: a committee formed
to improve articulation between colleges and secondary schools in the state, and
the emerging role of mathematicians within the College Entrance Examination
Board, located in Princeton. Due to the efforts of two individuals who had been
active in our section up to that time, Dean Albert E. Meder of Rutgers and Albert
W. Tucker of Princeton, the New Jersey Section met for the first time on
November 3, 1956, at Rutgers. From that time onward any MAA member who
lived in New Jersey became a member of the new section unless another
preference was indicated. The by-laws of the New Jersey Section have been
lauded for attention to detail, with most of the credit going to our section’s
former chairman, Cyril A. Nelson. Nelson’s affiliation was listed as Douglass
College of Rutgers University, the name given to the former New Jersey College
for Women in 1955 in honor of its first dean, Mabel Smith Douglass.
</p>
<p>
As might be expected, attendance at wartime meetings was lower than in other
years, yet interest was sufficient to sustain the meetings every Thanksgiving. The
27 people who attended the 1944 meeting at the University of Pennsylvania was
the smallest since the organizational meeting in 1926, a result of gas rationing as
well as war activity by the membership, but attendance rebounded nicely to 48
the following year. Once again the low attendance at the 1950 meeting held
outside the Philadelphia area at Lehigh University reflects the degree to which
travel difficulties continued for MAA members. Except for the record-setting
attendance at the Princeton meeting in 1954, meetings held in suburban
Philadelphia drew the largest numbers, attracting slightly more members than
meetings held in the city. Recall that the Philadelphia Section no longer included
central Pennsylvania during the 1940s, which provides a partial explanation for
the decrease in attendance figures shown in the remaining columns of <xref ref="Table11">Table</xref>,
especially during the period 1942-1946. Overall, an average of 57 people
attended meetings during this 14-year period, up somewhat from the average of
51 who attended the preceding nine meetings; 40 of the 57 belonged to the MAA,
or 70% – an increase from the 60% from the previous period.
</p>
<p>
Two special events took place at the annual meetings during this period. The
first is reflected in the official report from the 1944 meeting at the University of
Pennsylvania, which states, <q>At the instance of Professor Dresden, appropriate
action was taken in memory of the late Professor James A. Shohat</q>. We have
already profiled Shohat in <xref ref="Emigres">Chapter</xref>. This chapter will cite his influence on C. J.
Rees (Delaware) and Alexander Tartler (Drexel), while <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref> will cite his
influence on Walter Lawton (Temple).
</p>
<p>
The other event concerns sectional governance. In 1953 it was voted to form
an Executive Committee consisting of <q>the chairman, the secretary, the program
chair, and the sectional governor</q>. Although membership on the Program
Committee is noted for the 1954 meeting, that committee is never mentioned in
any reports, its role having been subsumed by the more expansive Executive
Committee.
</p>
<p>
The report from 1954 provides the first mention of a governor. Initially a
Board of Trustees administered the national MAA, with 12 of its members being
elected at large. In 1939 these elected members were designated as governors and
a Board of Governors replaced the Board of Trustees. Both boards included the
Association’s officers. The 1939 national by-laws stated that there would be 14
governors elected biennially by regions. Just six years later these unwieldy
regions were eliminated in favor of one governor from each section of the MAA.
We defer discussion of the section’s governors until <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref>.
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Leaders</title>
<p>
<xref ref="Table12">Table</xref> addresses the section’s governance based on elections held at annual
meetings from 1942 through 1955. Recall our convention that the year 1942
means that Drexel’s James E. Davis was elected chairman of the section at the
meeting held in November 1942 but carried out most of his duties during the year
1943, including the running of the annual meeting that year. The section
continued to benefit from a cadre of active leaders, altogether boasting 12
different chairmen in 14 years, with Cyril Nelson (Women’s College of New
Jersey) and Perry Caris (University of Pennsylvania) the only chairs elected to
two (nonconsecutive) terms. Many other contributions by Caris have already
been cited, principally his service as secretary from 1928 through 1941.

<p><foreign>Chairs</foreign></p>
<p>
The dozen chairmen represent a diverse lot in several ways. Geographically
scattered, they span the section from the University of Delaware in the west to
Rutgers in the east. The most notable change that occurred during this period was
the emergence of MAA members from Delaware into positions of sectional
leadership. Until this time the only faculty member from Delaware to participate
in any functions sponsored by the section was G. A. Harter. The first official
elected to office from the state of Delaware was C. J. Rees in 1946. His colleague
G. Cuthbert Webber followed three years later. We profile Webber at the end of
the chapter to honor his many contributions to the section during this period.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Carl John Rees</term> (1896-1986) was born in Millersville, PA. He received his
    A.B. degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall in 1918 and joined the faculty at the
    University of Delaware two years later. While continuing to teach at
    Delaware he obtained a masters degree from the University of Chicago in
    1925, probably taking classes at Chicago’s famed summer session. He
    received his Ph.D. under section chair J. A. Shohat at Penn in 1940. At that
    time, Rees was appointed chairman of the department at Delaware, a
    position he held for the next ten years. He became the Dean of the School of
    Graduate Studies at Delaware in 1950, holding the post until 1962. In the
    meantime he also served as Provost of the University from 1955 to 1962.
    Rees retired as professor emeritus in 1962. He died in Newark, Delaware, in
    1986, just three months shy of his 90 th birthday.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Like the University of Delaware, Rutgers provided the section with two
chairmen whose terms were separated by three years. At Rutgers, however, C. A.
Nelson (New Jersey College for Women, Rutgers University) and E. P. Starke
(Rutgers University) represented two separate divisions within the same
institution. Nelson was elected chair of the section in 1944, and Starke in 1947.
Nelson again served as chair in 1952-1953. Recall that Richard Morris of Rutgers
was the first person from New Jersey to be elected to the office in 1934.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Cyril Arthur Nelson</term> (1893-1984) was born and raised in Kansas. He
    received his A.B. degree from Midland College (Kansas) in 1914 and his
    A.M. from the University of Kansas in 1916. He enrolled in the graduate
    program at Princeton University for the year 1916-1917 before transferring
    to the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1919 without
    an official supervisor. Nelson taught at three different colleges before
    accepting a position in 1927 at the New Jersey College for Women, which
    was founded in 1918 and later became affiliated with Rutgers University.
    He remained at Rutgers until his retirement in 1959. He died in 1984 at the
    age of 90.
  </li>
  <li>
    <term>Emory P. Starke</term> 1896-1989) was born in New York City. He received all
    three of his degrees from Columbia University: A.B. 1916, M.A. 1917, and
    Ph.D. 1928. He joined the faculty at Rutgers in 1919 at age 23 and stayed
    there until compulsory retirement as professor emeritus in 1961. Instead of
    retiring completely, however, Starke spent the next five years as a professor
    at Bloomfield College. An inveterate problem solver, he is known to many
    present EPADEL members for his longtime stint of Associate Editor of the
    <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> and for his many contributions to its problems department. He took
    over the advanced problems section of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> in 1947 when that
    department’s first editor, Otto Dunkel, asked to be relieved. Starke died in
    1989 at age 93.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  In striking contrast to Delaware and Rutgers, only one person from Penn held
the chairmanship during this period, Perry Aquila Caris, who was elected in 1945
and in 1950. Recall that he had served as secretary of the section from 1928 to
1941 and as a member of the Program Committee from 1931 through 1933.
</p>
<p>
Tiny Bryn Mawr College provided two sterling leaders during the perio had
1942-1955, the venerable Anna Wheeler (chair in 1943) and the renowned John
Oxtoby (chair in 1955). Their contributions are detailed in profiles at the end of
the chapter. The election of Wheeler in 1943 marked the first time a woman was
elected chair of the section. The next woman to be so elected was Marguerite
Lehr in 1958; she too hailed from Bryn Mawr. The first woman from another
school to be elected chair was Doris Schattschneider (Moravian College) in 1977.
No woman was chosen to head the section during the 1980s, but conditions
changed dramatically in the next decade when three women were elected to two
one-year terms: Nancy Hagelgans (Ursinus College), 1991-1993; Louise Berard
(Wilkes College), 1995-1997; and Kay Somers (Moravian College), 1997-1999.
</p>
<p>
For now we provide biographical sketches of the remaining five chairs in the
order of their terms.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>James Elmer Davis</term> (1887-1964) was born and raised in Wisconsin. He
attended the Wisconsin State Normal School from 1901 to 1905 but for
unknown reasons left without obtaining a degree. He then taught at public
schools in Wisconsin and South Dakota until 1910, whereupon he enrolled
at the University of Wisconsin, earning two degrees, a bachelors in 1912
and a masters in 1913. That year Davis accepted a position at the
Pennsylvania State College (now University), so his affiliation was listed as
Penn State when he became a charter member of the national MAA in 1916.
He served in the army during World War I from 1917 through 1919. In the
early 1920s he taught at the University of Wisconsin and the University of
Arkansas before accepting a position at the Drexel Institute of Technology
in the fall of 1923. He remained in the EPADEL region for the rest of his
professional career, almost all of it spent at Drexel, where he served as chair
of the department from 1942 until his retirement in 1952. Davis was an
active member of the MAA from the time he attended the annual MAA
meeting at the University of Pennsylvania in 1926. He attended almost all of
the section’s annual meetings and played a pivotal role in the section’s being
able to hold annual meetings throughout World War II. Davis’s election to
head the Philadelphia Section made him the first in a line of chairs from
Drexel who held that office each decade from the 1940s through the 1980s.
He died in Florida in 1964 after having been an MAA member for 48 years.
  </li>
<li>
  <term>George Emil Raynor</term> (1895-1975) was born in San Francisco. He earned
his B.A. degree from the University of Washington (Seattle) in 1918 and
two degrees from Princeton, a masters in 1920 and a Ph.D. in 1923. A stint
in the Army in 1918 prevented him from completing his dissertation sooner.
After teaching at two colleges, Raynor accepted a position at Lehigh
University in 1931. He remained there for the rest of his life, directing the
doctoral dissertation of one student. In 1948 he was selected as the head of
the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy, a position he held until
1960. He retired as professor emeritus in 1964. Raynor was one of only two
chairs of the Philadelphia Section to hail from a Lehigh Valley institution
during the period 1942-1955.
</li>
<li>
  <term>Frank Leroy Manning</term> (1898-1986) was born in Mount Hope, New York.
He received a B.S. at Cornell in 1919 after having spent the year 1917-1918
with the U.S. Naval Reserves. Later he obtained an M.S. degree in
mathematics (1924) from Rutgers and a Ph.D. in statistics (1935) from
Cornell. During the 1920s Manning taught high school in New Jersey for
two years before becoming a principal in New York the next two years.
After a two-year stint at a state teacher’s college, he accepted a position at
Ursinus College in 1930. He remained at Ursinus for the rest of his career
except for the war years 1942-1944, when he taught extension courses in
engineering science and management for the war-training program
conducted by Penn State. He died in Collegeville at the age of 88.
</li>
<li>
  <term>Alexander Tartler</term> (1905-1985) was born in Budapest, Hungary. He
received two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, a bachelors in
1928 and a Ph.D. five years later. Like Delaware’s C. J. Rees, his
dissertation was written under J. A. Shohat. After earning his undergraduate
degree he joined the faculty at the Drexel Institute of Technology and
remained there until 1949, when he moved to Lafayette College. Although
Tartler was promoted to full professor and department chairman at Lafayette
in 1951, he returned to Drexel the very next year to accept an offer of these
same two positions. He retained the chairmanship until 1966 and retired four
years later. Tartler was known by his students as a very rigorous instructor
whose backboard writings were works of art. Although he drove many
engineering students crazy with his precision, this trait inspired several
engineering-to-mathematics converts. Tartler died at <m>B0^{th}</m> birthday.
</li>
<li>
  <term>Truman Lester Koehler</term> (1902-1989) was a Lehigh Valley citizen through
and through. Born in Bethlehem, PA, he graduated from Muhlenberg
College in 1924, taught at Allentown Prep School for the next three years,
and then joined the faculty of his alma mater in 1927. He remained there for
45 years and chaired the mathematics department for 14 of them. During
this time, Koehler managed to pick up his M.A. in 1932 and his Ph.D. in
1950 – both from the University of Pennsylvania. His doctorate was in
mathematics education for a dissertation titled, <q>The selection of certain
significant concepts in college algebra and the determination of their degree
of emphasis in some widely adopted texts</q>. In World War II, Koehler
directed Muhlenberg’s Engineering, Science, Management, and War
Training Program and, as noted above, served as chair of the Philadelphia
Section 1954-1955. He died in 1989, just two weeks shy of his 87 th birthday.
His son, Truman Koehler, Jr. – a statistician and successful businessman –
has been instrumental in keeping alive the memory of his father by generous
contributions to the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Muhlenberg.
These include a gift of Euler’s mathematical works to the college library, the
commissioning of portraits of his parents that now hang outside the
departmental offices (Mrs. Koehler was a friend of the students for the better
part of half a century), and an endowment for the Truman Koehler
Professorship. The present Koehler Professor of Mathematics is William
Dunham, who, as many MAA members can attest, has taken full advantage
of Koehler’s bequest of Euler’s works.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><foreign>Secretaries</foreign></p>
<p>
The position of secretary of the section changed dramatically during the 1940s
after having been under P. A. Caris’s direction from 1928 to 1941. Indeed, except
for the organizational year of 1926, every secretary came from the University of
Pennsylvania until 1947. P. M. Whitman succeeded P. A. Caris for three years.
He was followed by W. H. Gottschalk for three years and T. A. Botts for one.
When Botts (from Delaware) was elected in 1947, it marked the first time the
position was not held by someone from Penn since A. A. Bennett held the post in
the section’s inaugural year, 1926-1927. Haverford College’s Cletus O. Oakley
succeeded Botts and held the office for three years. The position returned to Penn
for 1951 and 1952, when R. D. Schafer held it. He was followed by former chair
G. C. Webber of the University of Delaware for the next three years.
</p>
<p>
We provided a sketch of Oakley earlier. Webber is profiled at the end of this
chapter. Now we sketch four other secretaries.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Philip Martin Whitman</term> (1916-1997) was born in
    Pittsburgh. He received a bachelors degree from Haverford College
    in 1937 and a Ph.D. in 1941 under Garrett Birkhoff at
    Harvard. Whitman spent the next three years at the University of
    Pennsylvania. Like almost all American mathematicians in the
    1940s, World War II interrupted Whitman’s career. During 1944-1946
    he was a scientist at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory at the
    University of California, which explains why his tenure as
    secretary ended in 1944. After the war Whitman taught at Tufts
    College for two years before moving to the Applied Physics Lab at
    Johns Hopkins University as a mathematician in 1948. In 1961 he
    left Johns Hopkins to become professor of mathematics and chairman
    of the department at Rhode Island College. Whitman died in
    Massachusetts at the age of 80.
  </li>
<li>
  <term>Walter Helbig Gottschalk</term> (1918-2004) was born in
  Lynchburg, Virginia.  He took all his higher education at the
  University of Virginia: B.S. 1939, M.A. 1942, and Ph.D. 1944 (under
  G. A. Hedlund). He went right from graduate school to the University
  of Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1963, serving as chairman
  of the department from 1954 to 1958. Gottschalk spent the academic
  year 1947-1948 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In
  1963 he accepted a professorship at Wesleyan University, where he
  remained until his retirement in 1982. An article from the 1999
  <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> titled <q>The Gottschalk-Hedlund Theorem</q> reflects the
  enduring influence of the advisor/student pair from their initial
  investigation 55 years earlier.
</li>
<li>
  <term>Truman Arthur Botts</term> was born in 1917 in Florida. He
  received his B.S.  degree in mathematics and physics from then-tiny
  Stetson University in Florida in 1938, followed by two degrees from
  the University of Virginia, a masters in 1940 and a Ph.D. in 1942
  (under E. J. McShane). He joined the faculty at the University of
  Delaware in 1946 but remained only two years before returning to
  Virginia. It was during his second year at Delaware that he was
  elected secretary of the section. Although his stint lasted but one
  year it foreshadowed administrative abilities that surfaced when he
  left the University of Virginia in 1968 to become Executive Director
  of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences. Today Botts is
  retired and living in Arlington, Virginia. He is best known for his
  book Real Analysis, written with his dissertation supervisor,
  E. J. (<q>Jimmy</q>) McShane, and first published in 1959.
</li>
<li>
  <term>Richard Donald Schafer</term> was born in 1918 in Buffalo, New
  York. He received two degrees from the University of Buffalo
  (B.A. 1938 and M.A.  1940) and a Ph.D. in 1942 from the University
  of Chicago (under A. A.  Albert). In 1942 he also married fellow
  graduate student Alice Turner right after the two of them had earned
  their degrees. R. D. Schafer was on the faculty at the University of
  Pennsylvania from 1948 to 1953, during which time he was secretary
  of our section 1951-1953. His wife served on the Program Committee
  during the year 1952-1953. However, the Schafers left Pennsylvania
  in 1953 when he became head of the department at the University of
  Connecticut. He accepted the position of deputy head at MIT in
  1959. Although he stepped down as deputy head in 1968, he remained
  on the faculty until his retirement in 1988. The Schafers reside in
  Lexington, MA.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before moving from secretary-treasurers to members of the Program
Committee, we pause to introduce <term>Alice T. Schafer</term>, wife
of R. D. Schafer and an outstanding mathematician in her own
right. Alice Schafer was one of the founding members of the
Association for Women in Mathematics in 1971 and its president from
1973 to 1975. In 1990 the Association for Women in Mathematics
established the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize to honor her for
her many years of unselfish and dedicated service towards increasing
the participation of women in mathematics. The prize is awarded every
year to an undergraduate woman in recognition of excellence in
mathematics courses and special programs. Two undergraduate students
from the EPADEL area were recognized for their mathematics excellence
in 1992, with Zvezdelina E. Stankova of Bryn Mawr winning the third
Schafer Prize and Eugénie Hunsicker of Haverford receiving honorable
mention. In 1999 Laura Ciobanu of Franklin &amp; Marshall earned honorable
mention.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, Alice T. Schafer received her Ph.D. from the University
of Chicago in 1942. Her dissertation on projective differential geometry was
written under department head Ernest P. Lane. She taught at Swarthmore and
Drexel, as well as several other institutions, before joining the faculty of
Wellesley College. She retired from there in 1980 as the Helen Day Gould
Professor of Mathematics, but after her husband’s retirement the couple moved to
Virginia, where she became a professor at Marymount University. She retired a
second time in 1996. The MAA bestowed its Distinguished Service to
Mathematics award on her in 1998.
</p>
<p>
The Schafers are the second mathematical couple we have encountered in this
history, following in the footsteps of Frederick and Helen Owens. We
subsequently describe the contributions of three other EPADEL couples –
Charles and Roseanne Hofmann, Anthony and Louise Berard, and William and
Penelope Dunham.
</p>
<p><foreign>Program Committee</foreign></p>
<p>
Next we discuss the section’s Program Committee, whose membership is
listed in <xref ref="Table12">Table</xref>. Recall that (C) denotes the chairman of the committee. <xref ref="Table12">Table</xref>
lists the three people who served on this committee in every year except 1942,
when the members were omitted in the official report. Recall that in 1953 this
committee became part of an enlarged Executive Committee. Although
membership on the Program Committee was no longer specified after 1954, we
included the 1955 membership of three people who were listed merely as
<q>committee members</q> in the report from the 1955 meeting.
</p>
<p>
During the period 1942-1955 a total of 33 different individuals served 39
separate terms on the Program Committee. The foci of Penn and Lehigh
dominated representation on the committee, each providing six members.
Altogether the Lehigh Valley accounted for nine of the 33 members and the city
of Philadelphia eight. Four items about membership on the committee are
noteworthy:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
a member on the committee came from Delaware for the first time (G. C.
Webber in 1945 and 1951),    
  </li>
<li>
  six members came from New Jersey, which formed its own state section in
the last year of this period,
</li>
<li>
  two members came from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster,
representing a geographical broadening of membership, and
</li>
<li>
  a member came from industry for the first time (Dr. Harold Luxenberg from
Remington Rand Corporation in Philadelphia, in 1953).
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
As we saw in earlier periods, many members of the Program Committee
also were elected to other offices so we provide biographical facts
the first time they held that office. However, during the period under
review three members who served multiple terms but were never elected
to other offices deserve special mention: F. L. Dennis, who was one of
four people to serve two terms, N. J. Fine, who was elected to three
terms in the period, and W. R. Murray. Some prominent names also
served one term on the committee: Arthur Everett Pitcher (Lehigh), I.
J. Schoenberg and A. D. Wallace (Penn), and A. W. Tucker and
J. W. Tukey (Princeton).
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Foster Leroy Dennis</term> (1910-1983) was born on New
    Year’s Day in West Milton, PA. He received a B.S. degree from
    Ursinus College in 1931, an M.S. from Cornell the next year, and a
    Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1938 (under Arnold
    Emch). Before enrolling at Illinois he taught at his alma mater,
    Ursinus, for one year, and he returned to the same department upon
    obtaining his doctorate. Although F. L. Dennis remained at Ursinus
    for the rest of his life, he also taught courses at a Penn State
    extension for two years during World War II, worked for the State
    Department of Public Instruction for a year, and was a consultant
    for Philco Corporation. He was a member of the Program Committee
    of the Philadelphia Section in 1944 and 1953.
  </li>
<li>
  <term>Nathan J. Fine</term> (1916-1994) was born, raised, and
  educated in Philadelphia.  He received a B.A. from Temple University
  in 1936, followed by two degrees from the University of
  Pennsylvania: A.M. 1939 and Ph.D. 1946 (under Antoni
  Zygmund). N. J. Fine studied for his doctorate while teaching high
  school for one year, teaching college (Cornell and Purdue) for three
  years, and being a research mathematician at both the Naval Ordnance
  Plant in Indiana and the Operations Evaluation Group in Washington,
  DC. He joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947
  and remained there until 1963. It was during this time that he was
  active with the Philadelphia Section. Fine moved to Penn State in
  1963 and spent the rest of his life there, having retired in 1978.
</li>
<li>
<term>Walter Rue Murray</term> (1905-1993) was born in Maryland but
received his early education in New Jersey. He earned a B.S. degree
from Colgate College in 1929 and then accepted an appointment at
Franklin &amp; Marshall College. While teaching there he pursued graduate
studies at Cornell, obtaining an M.S. in 1932. He returned to Cornell
from 1938 to 1940 to continue his graduate studies, but he never
earned a doctorate because his dissertation advisor, R. J. Walker, was
called into government service in connection with WWII. The proposed
title of his thesis was <q>Linear systems of plane curves</q>. Known as
<q>Rue</q> Murray, he was appointed head of the department at F &amp; M in 1945
after serving as acting head for sixth months.  He presented an
invited address to the section in 1936 and was a member of Program
Committee in 1945. He stepped down as chair in 1951. Murray died in
1993 just one month shy of his 88 th birthday.
</li>
</ul>

<section>
  <title>Presenters</title>
<p>
The Philadelphia Section sponsored 56 presentations involving 58 speakers at
the 14 annual meetings held from 1942 to 1955. The 1954 meeting included a
discussion by three people that accounts for the disparity in the two numbers.
After discussing the presenters and their affiliations, we take a chronological tour
of the meetings to analyze sectional activity from this perspective, after which we
discuss the lectures in terms of mathematical classification. Unlike previous
chapters, however, we do not list a separate table of the presentations. The
interested reader is referred to the appendix for the complete list in this period.
</p>
<p>
Altogether 50 different individuals account for the 58 presenters, a number
that clearly indicates a wide span of invited speakers. Nobody spoke more than
two times over the 14-year period, with eight different people appearing twice:
Bernard Epstein (1950, 1951), Nathan Fine (1947, 1952), Ralph Fox (1945,
1953), Herman Goldstine (1949, 1954), Marguerite Lehr (1944, 1954), Francis
Murnaghan (1944, 1947), John Oxtoby (1943, 1949), and Isaac Schoenberg
(1942, 1949). Epstein, Fine, and Schoenberg were at Penn at the time of their
presentations, Lehr and Oxtoby at Bryn Mawr, Fox at Princeton, Goldstine at the
Institute for Advanced Study, and Murnaghan at Johns Hopkins. Epstein’s talks
in consecutive years mark the only time that has happened in the history of the
section.
</p>
<p>
Institutional affiliations are as diverse as the range of speakers, with 18
different institutions accounting for the 58 presenters. Once again the University
of Pennsylvania led the way, with 10 speakers, followed by Bryn Mawr College
and Princeton University (7 each), Lehigh University and the University of
Delaware (5 each), Haverford College and the Institute for Advanced Study (4
each), and Swarthmore College (3). The preceding chapter noted that only once
in the section’s 75-year history were there lectures by two individuals from the
same institution at the same fall meeting. That happened in 1952 when the
University of Delaware’s Russell Remage and E. V. Lewis spoke. At the
opposite end of the spectrum, Penn’s 10 lectures in the present period were
delivered in 10 different years. It is relevant to point out that a total of 13
speakers came from institutions located in New Jersey because that state formed
its own section in 1956, the last year of the period under discussion.
</p>
<p>
F. D. Murnaghan was one of the few speakers who were invited from
outside the area at that time. Others who came from beyond the
section’s boundaries were Colonel R. C. Yates (U. S. Military Academy)
in 1951 and Morris Kline (NYU) in 1955. Five other speakers were
invited in the midst of their stays at institutions in the area,
though their normal affiliations were elsewhere. Three of these
positions were war related: Haskell Curry was on leave from Penn State
at the Frankford Arsenal in 1942, and A. A. Bennett and D. H. Lehmer
were at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, on leave from Brown in 1943 and
Berkeley in 1945, respectively. We might also mention that in 1954
Ernst Snapper was a visiting professor at Princeton University from
the University of Southern California and the famous A. S. Besicovitch
was a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from
Cambridge University in England.
</p>
<p>
Now we take a chronological tour of annual meetings from 1942 to 1955,
highlighting some of the more notable events. We already observed, for
instance, that three of the speakers worked at war-related
institutions at the time they spoke to our section. At the first
meeting held after the U.S. entered the war, the title of the talk by
Lehigh’s G. E. Raynor was <q>Exterior ballistics</q>. This is the same
meeting at which Haskell Curry spoke while assigned to the Frankford
Arsenal in North Philadelphia, though his topic was Heaviside
operators. Hilda Geiringer, an émigré who was teaching at Bryn Mawr at
the time, spoke on numerical solutions of linear problems, but her
talk concerned pure rather than applied mathematics.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Hilda Geiringer</term> (1893-1973) was born in Vienna, Austria. She received all
of her degrees from the University of Vienna, where she attended lectures
from Sigmund Freud and obtained her doctorate in mathematics in 1917
with a thesis on Fourier series in two variables. She worked at the Institute
of Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin until forced to leave
when Hitler came to power in 1933. She spent the year 1933-1934 in
Brussels, then taught in Istanbul, Turkey, for the next five years. She
immigrated to the United States in 1939, teaching at Bryn Mawr College for
five years. While there she married the Harvard mathematician Richard von
Mises (1883-1953) in 1943. One year later Geiringer-von Mises accepted a
position as professor and chair of the mathematics department at Wheaton
College in Massachusetts, to be near her husband. She retired from Wheaton
in 1959.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Returning to the theme of war-related activities in the section, the 1943
meeting featured an invited talk by one of the section’s three founders, A. A.
Bennett of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The topic of Major Bennett’s talk was
Euclidian geometry rather than the ballistics research he was involved with on a
daily basis. Another speaker, J. B. Rosser from the National Defense Research
Committee, chose to talk about a mathematical subject (many-valued logics)
instead of a more bellicose topic. The minutes from the 1943 meeting also reflect
the war in progress by setting a <q>tentative</q> date for the 1944 meeting, which
actually was held on the date assigned a year later. Recall that national MAA
meetings were cancelled in 1942 and 1945.
</p>
<p>
The program in 1943 featured the section’s first talk on foundations when J.
B. Rosser spoke <q>On the many-valued logics</q>. This was the first time the section
heard a talk on foundations, which is rather surprising in light of the fact that
Alonzo Church and Kurt Gödel had propelled Princeton into worldwide
leadership in the field since the 1930s. However, neither of these stalwarts ever
attended a sectional meeting. Theodore Hailperin in 1948 and C. D. Firestone in
1950 gave other talks on foundations during this period.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, the 1944 meeting of the Philadelphia Section did not reflect the
ongoing war. Even Marguerite Lehr’s talk, <q>Mapping problems in aerial
photography,</q> dealt with a method employed by the Canadian Topographical
Survey and not with a theme that the title might otherwise suggest. The only
vestige of World War II at the 1945 meeting was that D. H. Lehmer’s affiliation
was listed as Aberdeen. However, the title of his talk was <q>Some graphical
methods in the theory of numbers</q>.
</p>
<p>
The 1945 meeting thus serves as a dividing line between wartime activities
and the period that followed. Although only 27 people attended the meeting in
1944, 44 attended in 1945 and 51 in 1946. All were held at the University of
Pennsylvania. The 1945 program consisted of only three lectures, but the
presenters were all outstanding mathematicians. One was Ralph Fox of Princeton
University, who spoke about homotopy groups. One was Antoni Zygmund, then
at Penn but soon to be enticed to the University of Chicago by Marshall Stone;
Zygmund spoke on his specialty, trigonometric series. The remaining speaker
was Derrick H. Lehmer, who taught at Lehigh University from 1934 to 1940 and
spoke to the section in 1939. For the record, D. H. Lehmer’s father was the
mathematician Derrick N. Lehmer, a 1900 Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.
Our Lehmer produced only two Ph.D. students, both at Berkeley, but his two
students are household names today and both have been extremely active with
the MAA – Tom Apostol and Ronald Graham.
</p>
<p>
By 1946 sectional meetings had returned to normal. Once again there were
three lectures at the meeting. This was the first of the two years that T. A. Botts
taught at the University of Delaware. He spoke on <q>Convex sets</q>. Next,
Haverford’s C. B. Allendoerfer spoke on <q>Slope in solid analytical geometry,</q>
the topic of a <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> paper that appeared earlier that year. Edwin Hewitt
delivered the third paper, <q>Generalizations of the Weierstrass approximation
theorem</q>. Hewitt was at Bryn Mawr for only one year, 1946-1947, so the
Program Committee is to be commended for its perspicacious invitation. Hewitt
himself received his Harvard Ph.D. under Marshall Stone.
</p>
<p>
Three of the four talks at the 1947 meeting at Bryn Mawr were delivered by
people who accepted multiple invitations to speak at the section’s annual
meetings. The day began with the first of Nathan Fine’s three lectures, <q>On
Walsh functions,</q> based on his 1946 dissertation with the same title written
under the supervision of A. Zygmund. The afternoon session featured F. D.
Murnaghan’s second lecture, on vector methods in teaching trigonometry and
geometry. He had spoken three years earlier on an article published in the
<pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, <q>The uniform tension of an elastic cylinder</q>. The final presentation of
the day was the third talk by the Princeton statistician S. S. Wilks, who
accompanied his remarks on statistical inference <q>with material on slides</q>. This
is the only mention of such technology in the history of the section.
</p>
<p>
Two of the three lectures at the 1948 meeting are deserving of special
mention. Theodore Hailperin (Lehigh) began the day with a talk titled, <q>Recent
advances in symbolic logic</q>. A. W. Tucker (Princeton) gave the other notable
lecture that year on game theory, the second of his three invited lectures to the
section. This one not only marked the first time the section heard about the
theory of games, but it marked the first topic to reflect a post-WWII national
trend.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <term>Theodore Hailperin</term> was born in Newark, New Jersey, in
    1915. He received a B.S. from Michigan in 1939 and a Ph.D. four
    years later at Cornell for the dissertation, <q>A set of axioms for
    logic</q>, written under Barkley Rosser. Hailperin taught at Cornell
    for one year after completing his doctorate, and then he worked at
    the Ballistic Research Laboratory for two years. He went to Lehigh
    in 1946 and, apart from a year’s absence as Research Associate
    with Sandia Laboratory, spent the rest of his academic career
    there. Hailperin directed four Ph.D. dissertations on foundations
    between 1961 and 1975. After retirement in 1980 he was appointed
    adjunct professor, supervising the mathematics offerings at
    Lehigh’s Learning Center. He resigned from that position in
    1996. He and his wife Ruth are now retired (she from Moravian) and
    living in Nazareth, PA.
  </li>
<li>
  <term>Albert William Tucker</term> o(1905-1995) was born in Oshawa,
  Canada. He obtained a B.A. at the University of Toronto in 1928 and
  then two degrees at Princeton University: M.A. 1929 and Ph.D. 1932
  (under the famous topologist, Solomon Lefschetz). Tucker joined the
  faculty at Princeton the next year and taught there until his
  retirement in 1974. Known for his seminal contributions to linear
  and non-linear programming and to game theory, he held Princeton’s
  prestigious Dod Professorship from 1954 until 1974. Tucker’s first
  Ph.D. student (in 1950) was John Nash, a Nobel Prize winner in
  economics. He also directed the 1972 dissertation of our own active
  member, Stephen Maurer. Two other Tucker mathematical products are
  his sons Thomas W. Tucker (Colgate) and Alan C. Tucker (SUNY - Stony
  Brook); the latter spoke to our section in 1982. A. W. Tucker died
  in Princeton at age 89.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A. W. Tucker’s talk on game theory was not the only time that sectional
audiences could listen to a world renowned specialist speak about a topic that
was then at the cutting-edge of research. Over the next five years, invited lectures
were given by Herman Goldstine in 1949 and 1954 on computers, by H. W.
Kuhn in 1953 linear programming, and by Ralph Fox in 1953 knot theory.
</p>
<p>
In addition to Herman Goldstine’s talk on applications of numerical analysis
to computing at the 1949 meeting, A. D. Hestenes of Philadelphia’s famous
science institution, the Franklin Institute, spoke about industrial research and
development organizations. The program also included the third lecture by Bryn
Mawr’s John Oxtoby in the 1940s, matching the three talks that J. A. Shohat
delivered in the 1930s and the three that Bernard Epstein would deliver in the
1950s.
</p>
<p>
The final lecture at the 1949 meeting was the second of four talks given by
Penn’s Isaac Schoenberg. In a similar vein, Albert Wilansky’s talk to begin the
1950 meeting was the first of the record-number five talks he would give to the
section, his others taking place in 1956, 1963, 1970, and 1983.
</p>
<p>
In the final address at the 1950 meeting at Lehigh, S. T. Hu of the Institute for
Advanced Study spoke on <q>Topological properties of spaces of curves</q>. During
this talk the speaker cited the work of our own Everett Pitcher in the field and
included a proof of Pitcher’s theorem characterizing when certain sets of curves
are metrizable.
</p>
<p>
All four talks at the 1951 meeting are deserving of mention. Two dealt with
the increasing attention being paid to mathematical pedagogy. The first speaker,
R. C. Yates of the U. S. Military Academy, described various topics that
stimulated interest in mathematics courses taken during the first two college
years. Yates had spoken to the section in 1938 when he was at the University of
Maryland. The day’s final speaker, P. J. Kiernan of the Lawrenceville School, a
private secondary school located near Princeton, discussed a theme that garnered
increasing interest throughout the 1950s, <q>Articulation of secondary and college
mathematics</q>. In between those two talks the famous algebraist Emil Artin spoke
about <q>Constructions with ruler and divider</q> and Bernard Epstein gave the first
of his three talks in the decade, titled <q>An infinite-product expansion for analytic
functions</q>.
</p>
<p>
The 1952 meeting featured talks on probability (by Samuel Goldberg of
Lehigh University) and statistics (by E. V. Lewis of the University of Delaware).
Russell Remage opened the meeting with a lecture titled <q>Matrix inversion by
partitioning</q>. Remage and Lewis continued the active Delaware involvement in
the section begun in the 1940s by Rees and Webber. We will meet Remage in the
next chapter as chairman of the section.
</p>
<p>
The next notable event to take place at an annual meeting was a presentation
in 1954 titled <q>Mathematics through the television lens</q>. Not exactly a panel
discussion, it featured three speakers who discussed various ways to teach
mathematics via this relatively new medium. Although panel discussions per se
did not start in the section for four more years, this program might be considered
the prototype of a format that has been used successfully on numerous occasions
since then. The 1954 meeting included three outstanding lectures in addition to
this presentation. To open the program Ernst Snapper talked on <q>Coordinates of
algebraic varieties</q>. The two lectures after lunch were <q>Area and volume</q> by A.
S. Besicovitch and <q>Some remarks on numerical stability</q> by Herman Goldstine.
Besicovitch’s topic was not surprising; 28 years earlier he had shown that there
exist planar regions of arbitrarily small area in which a segment of fixed length
could be rotated, thus solving the Kakeya needle problem. Goldstine
demonstrated the electronic computer that had been developed at the Institute for
Advanced Study. Goldstine, a 1936 Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, was
appointed a permanent member of the Institute in 1952 and served as the
associate director of the electronic computer project there from 1946 to 1955.
Although born in 1913, hence approaching his 90 th birthday, Goldstine remains
active with the American Philosophical Society, located on Independence Mall in
Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
The last meeting in this period began with a discussion by H. W. Brinkmann
of work carried out under the auspices of the College Entrance Examination
Board. As we saw in the preceding chapter, Brinkmann was one of the most
active mathematicians in the section during the 1930s; he would speak to the
section again in the 1960s! Brinkmann was followed on the program by another
émigré, Hans Rademacher, who spoke on one of his favorite subjects, Dedekind
sums. Two notable speakers ended the day. The renowned probabilist William
Feller, yet another émigré, spoke about differential operators. In the final talk of
this period NYU’s multifaceted Morris Kline spoke about material that he felt
should be included in courses taught to college freshmen. Given Kline’s work in
applied mathematics and his interest in the history, cultural, and pedagogical
aspects of mathematics, it is not surprising that his talk carried the unusual title
<q>Pea soup, tripe and mathematics</q>.
</p>
</section>
<section>
  <title>Themes of Lectures</title>
<p>
We end the chapter with a mathematical classification of the lectures
sponsored by the Philadelphia Section at annual meetings from 1942 to 1955.
Analysis continued to be the leading choice of fields during this period, though
the topology/geometry union presented a serious challenge to its dominance. The
present period is also notable for the emergence of foundations as an attractive
subject. However, two fields with little or no history in the section garnered even
stronger interest – applications and education/pedagogy.
</p>
<p>
The reader is urged to keep in mind that it is often difficult to place certain
mathematical papers into one category or another, even when the entire paper is
available. This task is further complicated when only an abstract, or, in some
situations, only a title, appears. The interested reader is reminded that the sources
for the secretaries’ official reports in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> are listed in <xref ref="Table11">Table</xref>.
</p>
<p><foreign>Analysis</foreign></p>
<p>
A compelling reason why analysis continued to be a major attraction at
sectional meetings was the existence of the internationally strong Penn School of
Analysis. <xref ref="Emigres">Chapter</xref> noted earlier contributions of Hans Rademacher, J. A.
Shohat, and J. A. Clarkson. During the period 1942-1955 the section heard five
talks by four new members of the Penn School, beginning with the 1945 lecture
by Antoni Zygmund, <q>Some unsolved problems in the theory of trigonometric
series</q>. Even though Zygmund accepted a position at the University of Chicago
the next fall, the Penn School continued its tradition of keeping the section
abreast of recent developments. Indeed, the object of N. J. Fine’s 1947 talk, <q>On
Walsh functions,</q> was to complete a system of functions described earlier by the
School’s reigning leader, Hans Rademacher. Five years before, I. J. Schoenberg
gave a talk <q>On a theorem of Jensen</q> that dealt with circles in the plane and roots
of polynomials but which we have classified under analysis because of a
familiarity with the speaker’s work. We drew the same conclusion about
Schoenberg’s 1949 paper <q>On smoothing operations,</q> even though section
secretary C. O. Oakley did not provide an abstract of this talk. There can be no
doubt that the two lectures delivered in 1950 and 1951 by Bernard Epstein
concerned analysis, however. The first one dealt with <q>The classification of
Schlicht functions,</q> a topic that concerns smooth (analytic) functions. Epstein’s
second talk had a similar theme, <q>An infinite-product expansion for analytic
functions</q>.
</p>
<p>
Talks on analysis were not given by the Penn School alone. Penn State’s H. J.
Curry, who was assigned to the Frankford Arsenal in 1942, spoke about <q>The
Heaviside operational calculus</q>. It would be 30 years before Curry would return
to deliver another lecture to the section. In 1950 Albert Wilansky spoke about his
emerging specialty, functional analysis, in a talk titled <q>The essential roughness
of mathematical objects</q>. Wilansky’s results were based on earlier findings by S.
Banach and A. Zygmund.
</p>
<p>
There were also two lectures during this period on ordinary differential
equations. In 1948 W. R. Wasow of Swarthmore College described the effects of
omitting terms whose coefficients are very small, especially when such equations
are being used to describe physical phenomena. Seven years later, in the
penultimate lecture of this period, William Feller took a more abstract approach
to differential equations by adopting an approach via operators.
</p>
<p>
Three lectures in this period dealt with numerical analysis. In the
first one, delivered in 1942 and titled <q>On modern methods in the
numerical solution of linear problems,</q> Hilda Geiringer took a
classical approach to solving systems of linear equations. Such was
not the case with Herman Goldstine’s two lectures, which reflected the
nascent stage of the computer revolution. In 1949 his lecture, titled
<q>Some problems in numerical analysis,</q> described one of the four major
sources of errors that occur in numerical computations – rounding
errors – which arise from the <q>noise</q> in the computing machine
itself. This theme was continued in his talk five years later on
numerical stability. At the conclusion of the lecture that completed
the 1954 meeting at Princeton, Goldstine was able to demonstrate his
results on the computer at the Institute for Advanced Study. This must
have been a real treat for the audience!
</p>
<p><foreign>Geometry/Topology</foreign></p>
<p>
Eleven talks were devoted to either geometry or topology during the period
1942-1955, seven of which dealt primarily with topology itself. Alexander
Doniphan Wallace, who taught at Penn 1941-1947 before going to Tulane and
Florida, opened the 1943 meeting with a lecture on <q>Fixed point theorems</q>. In
his talk Wallace applied Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem to a surprising realm, the
theory of matrices. Two years later Wallace’s colleague, W. H. Gottschalk,
known for his book on topological dynamics, spoke on <q>Continuous flows and
AP functions</q>. Here AP stands for almost periodic.
</p>
<p>
R. H. Fox, known as an excellent speaker and expositor, opened the 1945
meeting with a lecture titled <q>Homotopy groups</q>. Although that subject tends to
be rather abstruse – Fox discussed algorithms for calculating homotopy groups –
he almost certainly presented the material in terms understandable to an MAA
audience. Three other talks during this period dealt with topology: Edwin Hewitt
(1946), <q>Generalizations of the Weierstrass approximation theorem,</q> J. C.
Oxtoby (1949), <q>Minimal sets,</q> and S. T. Hu (1950), <q>Topological properties of
spaces of curves</q>.
</p>
<p>
Four talks during the period were concerned with assorted topics in geometry.
In 1943 the section’s founder A. A. Bennett interacted with the section on a
formal basis for the last time when he delivered an address titled <q>Some modern
viewpoints on euclidian [sic] geometry</q>. Bennett’s talk <q>arose from discussion of
an elementary Hermetian [sic] geometry of the general simplex,</q> suggesting a
topological connection. We do not know the reason for the nonstandard
orthography in Major Bennett’s title and abstract.
</p>
<p>
All three talks at the 1946 meeting at Penn dealt with geometry or topology.
T. A. Botts opened the program with a lecture on <q>Convex sets</q> in the Euclidean
plane, C. B. Allendoerfer followed with <q>Slope in solid analytic geometry,</q> and
E. Hewitt gave the third one mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
The remaining two talks on geometry occurred in the 1950s. In 1954 A. S.
Besicovitch applied methods from topology to solve problems with <q>Area and
volume</q>. The following year R. J. Wisner of Haverford College reported on joint
work he had carried out with his colleague C. O. Oakley on <q>Flexagons,</q>
geometrical objects related to n-dimensional polygons for <m> n \ge 3</m>.
</p>
<p>
<foreign>Algebra/Number Theory</foreign>
</p>
<p>
Eight lectures dealt with topics in the algebra/number theory category, but
only two concerned topics in algebra proper, thus continuing the limited offerings
in this field. In 1951 Emil Artin lectured on <q>Constructions with ruler and
divider,</q> where the divider, as opposed to a compass, was fixed and not free. The
following year Russell Remage lectured on <q>Matrix inversion by partitioning</q>.
The talk by Ernst Snapper in 1954, <q>Coordinates of algebraic varieties,</q> lay at
the boundary of algebra and geometry.
</p>
<p>
Five of the papers delivered during this period dealt with number theory, two
of which dealt with continued fractions: G. C. Webber (1943), <q>Transcendality of
certain continued fractions,</q> and V. F. Cowling (1947), <q>Convergence criteria for
continued fractions</q>. Cowling taught at Lehigh from 1949 to 1961 before moving
to the University of Kentucky. One of his first doctoral students there, Jerry
King, has been extremely active in the section since coming to Lehigh in 1962
with a newly minted Ph.D.
</p>
<p>
In 1945 D. H. Lehmer applied his specialty, computing, to arithmetical
theorems concerning compositions and partitions of numbers in an address titled
<q>Some graphical methods in the theory of numbers</q>.
</p>
<p>
As we noted at the end of <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter</xref>, one of the section’s founders, Howard
Mitchell, presented a lecture at the 1932 meeting on <q>The life and work of
Ramanujan</q>. Twenty years later the section heard a talk on Ramanujan’s work
again when N. J. Fine extended some of Ramanujan’s results in a talk titled
briefly <q>The Ramanujan identities</q>. Fine subsequently moved from Penn to Penn
State. In <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter</xref> we noted that one of Fine’s colleagues, George Andrews,
lectured on this same subject in 1990.
</p>
<p>
Hans Rademacher delivered the final talk on number theory in 1955, titled
<q>Dedekind sums and classes of modular substitutions</q>. He had planned to lecture
on this same subject when he accepted the invitation to deliver MAA’s Hedrick
Lecture in 1963, but illness prevented him from giving the talk. However, his
doctoral student Emil Grosswald, who would become the section’s governor
1965-1968, delivered the lecture in his place. Grosswald further memorialized
Rademacher’s work in the field by editing and expanding Rademacher’s notes
into the 1972 Carus Monograph <em>Dedekind Sums</em>.
</p>
<p><foreign>Probability/Statistics</foreign></p>
<p>
We mentioned that the period 1942-1955 was notable for sponsoring the first
talks on foundations, beginning with a talk by J. B. Rosser in 1943 titled <q>On the
many-valued logics</q>. Five years later Lehigh’s Theodore Hailperin discussed
<q>Recent advances in symbolic logic,</q> while two years after that Penn’s C. D.
Firestone described <q>Systems of axiomatic set theory</q>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to talks on foundations, the period 1942-1955 is notable also for its
strong emphasis on curriculum/pedagogy and applications.
</p>
<p><foreign>Curriculum/Pedagogy</foreign></p>
<p>
Whereas five lectures in the period 1933-1941 dealt with either curricular or
pedagogical issues, the present period sponsored seven, highlighted by the three-
person presentation <q>Mathematics through the television lens</q> at the 1954
meeting. Since the presentation consisted of three people describing their
experiences in designing new ways to communicate mathematics using an
emerging technology, the presentation serves as a preview of one that might be
conducted today under the title <q>Mathematics on the Internet</q>. First, F. G. Fender
reported on a 13-week series of talks presented on TV at his home institution,
Rutgers. The aim of this series was to help the general public gain a clearer
understanding of <q>the story of the modern mathematician and his work</q>. Next
Bryn Mawr’s Marguerite Lehr described a 15-week series of half-hour talks
presented on one of Philadelphia’s three major channels. (For details on the
series see her article in the January 1955 <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, pp. 15-21.) In the final part of
the presentation, Delaware’s R. F. Jackson bonded two emerging technologies
when he outlined the general philosophy and specific plans for a TV series titled
<q>Thinking machines – From fingers to flip-flops</q>.
</p>
<p>
A prevailing folklore asserts that the launching of Sputnik in 1957 not only
began the space age but also launched mathematics education in the United
States into the 20 th century. Activities in our section throughout the decade prior
to the Russian launch belie that assertion. Indeed, activities at our section’s
annual meetings show that American mathematical educators were quite
concerned about the status of their offerings and were in the process of making
changes even before the historic lift-off. In addition to the series on television the
section sponsored six other lectures that dealt with high school and college
curricula. In 1947 F. D. Murnaghan strongly advocated the use of vector methods
in teaching trigonometry and analytic geometry. The meeting four years later
included two talks that dealt with educational issues, <q>The stimulation of
interest</q> by R.C. Yates and <q>Articulation of secondary and college mathematics</q>
by P. J. Kiernan. As noted above, Yates described topics that stimulated interest
in mathematics courses taken during the first two years of college, including
<q>linkages, cams, paper folding</q> and more. The prep-school teacher Kiernan
noted, <q>Aside from the curriculum, the major point brought up was that of
reading ... the college teacher must continue the training of the student in the
intensive type of reading that mathematics requires</q>. Kiernan reported that the
issue arose from a panel discussion conducted under the auspices of the New
Jersey Committee on the Articulation of Colleges and Secondary Schools.
</p>
<p>
In 1953 C. O. Oakley presented a talk titled <q>A new approach to freshman
mathematics</q> in which the master expositor reported on an ambitious freshman
course developed over the previous seven years at Haverford College. How
ambitious? The syllabus included topics in logic, groups, the number system,
fields, functions, analytic geometry, calculus of polynomials, probability and
statistics. Two more lectures on educational themes were delivered at the final
meeting of the present period, held at Bryn Mawr College in 1955. H. W.
Brinkmann began the day’s program with <q>A report on the Ford Foundation
study on the integration of high school and college mathematics</q>. In this lecture
Brinkmann summarized the results of mathematics examinations administered
that spring by the Conference of Mathematics Teachers in coordination with the
College Entrance Examination Board. As noted above, in the final lecture of the
day Morris Kline strongly recommended that in all freshman courses,
<q>mathematics be tied intimately to physical problems and to its cultural setting
and significance</q>.
</p>
<p><foreign>Applications</foreign></p>
<p>
Speaking of applications of mathematics, our section never offered so many
talks on this topic in its 75-year history. Their titles indicate the broad scope of
the applications covered. Not surprisingly, many of these talks took place during
World War II, including three of the four lectures given in 1944: G. E. Raynor
(1942), <q>Exterior ballistics,</q> Peter van de Kamp (1943), <q>Photographic
astrometry,</q> Marguerite Lehr (1944), <q>Mapping problems in aerial
photography,</q> F. L. Dennis (1944), <q>Spherical triangles on a slide rule,</q> and F.
D. Murnaghan (1944), <q>The uniform tension of an elastic cylinder</q>. The two
post-war talks on applications were A. D. Hestenes (1949), <q>Some observations
relative to mathematics in research and development organizations</q> and Jan
Tinbergen (1953), <q>Mathematical techniques used in economics theory</q>.
</p>
<p>
Overall, one can see that from 1942 to 1955 the Philadelphia Section (1) was
kept abreast of developments in analysis and topology/geometry on a regular
basis, (2) remained somewhat in the dark on topics in abstract algebra, (3) was
apprised periodically of work done in foundations and in probability/statistics,
(4) showed an interest in applications, especially during World War II, and (5)
began to take a close look at educational issues relating to the high-school
curriculum and the first two years in college.

  <title>Profile: John Corning Oxtoby (1910-1991)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> John Corning Oxtoby (1910-1991)</h></idx>
<p>
John C. Oxtoby was born on September 14, 1910, in Saginaw, Michigan, the
son of William Henry and Ida Jane (Corning) Oxtoby. He received two degrees
in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley, an A.B. in 1933
and an M.A. the following year. He was the president of the Pi Mu Epsilon
fraternity at Berkeley for two years, 1932-1934. During this time he delivered
one talk each year to the honorary organization, the first titled <q>Number ratios</q>
and the second <q>Dimensional analysis</q>. For the next two years Oxtoby enrolled
in the graduate program at Harvard University, where he served as the secretary-
treasurer of the Harvard Mathematical Club for 1935-1936.
</p>
<p>
Following graduation Oxtoby remained at Harvard for three years as a Junior
Fellow in the Society of Fellows. He was in good company. Between 1933 and
1944, the ranks of junior fellows included the famed economist Paul Samuelson,
the noted psychologist B. F. Skinner, and the mathematical logician W. V. Quine,
as well as the mathematicians Garrett Birkhoff, Creighton Buck, Lynn Loomis,
and Stanislaw Ulam. During this time Oxtoby and Ulam proved that almost every
measure-preserving homeomorphism of any <q>regularly connected</q> polyhedron of
dimension <m>\ge 2</m> is metrically transitive. As the authors noted in their joint paper in
the July 1939 issue of the Annals, <q>the effect of the ergodic theorem was to
replace the ergodic hypothesis (of Ehrenfest) by the hypothesis of metric
transitivity (of G. D. Birkhoff)</q>. In reviewing this paper Garrett Birkhoff wrote,
<q>This constituted a notable modern extension of the tradition of Lagrange,
Laplace, Poincaré, and G. D. Birkhoff</q>.
</p>
<p>
Clearly Oxtoby was a brilliant research mathematician. He had published
several papers by the time he left Harvard in 1939. Since holding a Junior
Fellowship carried more prestige than writing a doctoral dissertation, Oxtoby,
like the others mentioned above, never felt the need to obtain a doctorate. He
accepted an assistant professorship at Bryn Mawr College in the fall of 1939, and
remained there until he retired as professor emeritus 40 years later, in 1979, at
age 68. Oxtoby served as the head of the department from 1948 until 1976.
Imagine – 28 years! He was appointed to the College’s prestigious Class of 1897
Professorship for the last four years of his active career.
</p>
<p>
Known as an especially effective teacher, Oxtoby received a Lindback Award
for Distinguished Teaching in 1978. Two years later, and only one year after
retiring, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Widener University. What is
the connection between Widener and Bryn Mawr, except that both schools are
located in the same general area of suburban Philadelphia? One of Oxtoby’s three
Ph.D. students, Francisco Navarro-Bermudez, was chairman of the mathematics
department at Widener at the time.
</p>
<p>
John Oxtoby served as chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1955-1956. He
had been even more active in sectional activities during the 1940s, being an
invited speaker at the annual meetings three times (1940, 1943, and 1949) and
serving on the Program Committee twice (1944 and 1947), chairing it in 1944. In
addition he was the MAA’s Hedrick Lecturer in 1956. He is perhaps best known
today for his small but influential book Measure and Category: A Survey of the
Analogies between Topological and Measure Space.
</p>
<p>
Oxtoby married Jean Ann Shaffer in 1945. The couple had three children, one
of whom, David William Oxtoby, is an author of the 1994 textbook Chemistry:
Science of Change. John Oxtoby died on January 2, 1991. His widow still resides
in Haverford, where the couple lived for most of their married life.

  <title>Profile: George Cuthbert Webber (1906-1981)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> George Cuthbert Webber (1906-1981)</h></idx>
<p>
George Cuthbert Webber was elected chairman of the Philadelphia Section in
1949. Born in Alberta, Canada, in 1906, Webber was awarded his Ph.D. degree
from the University of Chicago in 1934 for a dissertation written under one of the
country’s leading algebraists, Leonard Dickson. Webber had obtained a B.S.
degree in 1930 and an M.A. degree two years later from the University of British
Columbia. He spent the years 1934-1936 as a National Research Council fellow,
the first year at Brown University and the second at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
Webber must have enjoyed the EPADEL area because after one year at Penn
and another at the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago, he moved to the
University of Delaware and remained there for the rest of his life. Appointed an
instructor in 1937, he rose through the ranks until becoming a full professor in
1948. One year later Webber was elected chairman of the Philadelphia Section.
The following year he succeeded C. J. Rees as chairman of the mathematics
department at Delaware, a position he held for 14 years. In addition, from 1958
to 1971 he also held the University’s prestigious H. Fletcher Brown
Professorship. He retired as emeritus professor in 1971.
</p>
<p>
Webber signed his name Cuthbert in all his sectional correspondence, but he
was generally called Bert at Delaware. Shortly after his death, the University
established a <q>Webber Award</q> for outstanding achievement in the field of
mathematics education. The first award was given in 1983; it has been given
every two years since then. The monetary award comes from an endowment left
to the University by Mrs. Webber.
</p>
<p>
Most of Webber’s publications dealt with topics in number theory. However,
he was also concerned about the mathematical education of elementary school
and secondary school teachers, which explains the conditions of the award named
in his honor.
</p>
<p>
Webber was a tireless worker for the Philadelphia Section in spite of time
constraints demanded by administrative duties at the University of Delaware. His
first activity with the section was an invited address delivered at the annual
meeting in 1943, <q>Transcendentality of certain continued fractions</q>. Based on
recent results of Siegel and Gelfond, this talk showed that Webber was able to
remain current with mathematical topics in spite of wartime activities.
</p>
<p>
Webber’s first official position in the section began two years later when he
was elected to the Program Committee in 1945. He was elected to this committee
again in 1951 and 1952. He also served a three-year stint as secretary of the
section.

  <title>Profile: Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler (1883-1966)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Wheeler, Anna Johnson Pell (1883-1966)</h></idx>
<p>
Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler was one of the best mathematicians to ever grace
our section. A charter member of the MAA, her national eminence brought
immediate legitimacy to the fledgling Philadelphia Section when it was founded
in 1926. However, her lot in life was certainly not an easy one.
</p>
<p>
Anna Johnson was born on May 5, 1883, in Hawarden, Iowa, where she
attended public school. Although the youngest of three children, she was the first
to attend college, entering the University of South Dakota at age 16 as a sub-
freshman. She graduated four years later with an A.B. degree in mathematics.
The professor of mathematics at South Dakota, Alexander Pell, became her
mentor. Anna then won a scholarship to the University of Iowa, where she earned
a masters degree in one year. Next she attended Radcliffe College, also on
scholarship. She was awarded a second masters degree the following year, 1905.
She remained at Radcliffe one more year before moving to Göttingen University,
where she attended lectures by Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann
Minkowski. The Palmer Fellowship that supported her study tour stipulated that
all women remain unmarried throughout its duration. Hence she waited until July
1907, to marry her former mathematics professor – over the opposition of her
parents, who objected to the 25-year age differential. Pell traveled to Göttingen
for the wedding.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards the couple returned to South Dakota, where Alexander Pell had
been promoted to Dean of Engineering. Anna Pell taught courses in the fall
semester, but in the spring she returned to Göttingen alone to complete work on
her thesis. An apparent disagreement with Hilbert caused her to leave without a
doctorate. However, she departed with a completed thesis. When Anna Pell
returned to the United States she joined her husband in Chicago. She was
awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1910 after satisfying the
university’s one-year residency requirement. It was only appropriate that E. H.
Moore be listed as her thesis advisor because Moore was a Hilbert enthusiast
who was involved with research on integral equations, the topic of Pell’s
dissertation, at that time.
</p>
<p>
In spite of having a Ph.D. from Chicago, Anna Pell was unable to obtain a
position at any large university. Her predicament was exacerbated by a paralytic
stroke her husband suffered in the spring of 1911. That fall she accepted a
position as an instructor at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. She was at
Mount Holyoke when she became one of the charter members of the national
MAA in 1916. In 1918 she accepted an assistant professorship at Bryn Mawr
College. Her husband died two years later. In addition to teaching graduate
courses, in 1924 Anna Pell succeeded Charlotte Angas Scott as head of the
mathematics department when the revered Scott stepped down.
</p>
<p>
However, Pell soon married again, this time to Arthur Wheeler, a
professor of classics at Princeton University. Residing in Princeton
forced her to resign her administrative duties at Bryn Mawr, but she
continued to teach there on a part- time basis. The Wheelers enjoyed
summer vacations at their summer home in the Adirondack Mountains
called <q>Q.E.D</q>. Unfortunately, her second husband died in 1932. After
this Anna Pell Wheeler returned to live and teach full time at Bryn
Mawr. The next year she was instrumental in attracting Emmy Noether to
the faculty, a hiring that brought an air of excitement and
international prestige to the Main Line campus. Unfortunately Pell’s
colleague and good friend Noether died unexpectedly in 1935, less than
two years after arriving.
</p>
<p>
The years 1920-1935 certainly brought much sadness to Anna Pell Wheeler,
for she lost her father, mother, two husbands, and a close friend/colleague. Yet
throughout this time and up to her retirement in 1948, she maintained a busy
work schedule at Bryn Mawr that also included weekly trips to a colloquium at
the University of Pennsylvania. In the 20-year period between 1922 and 1942 she
managed to direct eight doctoral dissertations.
</p>
<p>
Although Wheeler presented an invited lecture to the Philadelphia Section, her
<url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> Colloquium Lecture in 1927 probably represents the highlight of her
professional speaking career. No woman would be chosen to deliver a lecture in
this prestigious series again until Julia Robinson in 1980.
</p>
<p>
Wheeler died on March 26, 1966, at the age of 82.
