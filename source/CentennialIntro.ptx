<p>
Chapters 7 and 8 explained how by the year 2000, the character of EPADEL had
been well established as an organization that sponsored a variety of
activities on pedagogical and curricular themes with a growing number
of volunteers from an ever-increasing diversity of leaders and
institutions.

<p>
This chapter discusses phase of the section characterized by a growth
in the number and variety of activities at section meetings, a
fundamental shift in attention to undergraduate students, and a
corresponding expansion of the volunteer corps of section leaders. The
chapter begins with an examination of the annual meetings held during
the 25-year period we will call the Centennial Era. The next part of
the chapter describes the major sectional initiatives carried out
during this period. The historical record for this period has suffered
during the transition from print newsletters to online documents,
particularly during the early 2000s when the section website was still
new. During this period there was an unfortunate lack of consistency
in preserving executive committee minutes and section meeting
programs.

<p>
In the Centennial Era, the range of section activities continued to
broaden and adapt to the topics and trends prevalent in mathematics,
academia more broadly, and society writ large. We describe these
activities in four broad categories: students (student paper
competitions, student activities at meetings, visiting lecture
series), professional development (Project NExT, Special Interest
Groups, broadening representation of women and other historically
excluded groups), education (workshops, distinguished teaching award,
contributed papers), and public policy (public information officers,
newspaper articles).   
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, the account of sectional activities is followed by a
brief look at leaders who shaped those activities over the past 25
years. We provide brief sketches of all presidents, secretaries,
treasurers, and section representatives, as well as a few other
selected individuals who served more than one term as At-Large member
of the EPADEL Executive Committee or contributed as a volunteer in
some particularly vital way.

The last part of the chapter analyzes the programs from all of the
fall and spring meetings in the modern era. The chapter ends with a
categorical analysis of the content of the invited lectures.

We note that this period included two major updates to bylaws that
affect the terminology in this chapter. The EPADEL Bylaws update of
2008 changed the term "President" to "Chair" and separated the
position of Secretary-Treasurer into two positions. The national MAA
Bylaws update of 2015 changed the governance structure to one where
sections send Representatives to the MAA Congress (which is largely
advisory) rather than a Governor to sit on a Board.
