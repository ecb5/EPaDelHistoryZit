        was born in Camden, New Jersey, and attended Rider
        College with a major in Mathematics and Secondary Education
        before doing her graduate work at Lehigh University. In 2002,
        she completed her PhD in Probability and Mathematical Finance
        under the direction of Vladimir Dobric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lisa took a tenure-track position at LaSalle University
        immediately upon graduation from Lehigh University, but the
        following year she moved into a tenure-track position at West
        Chester University. She has remained at WCU to this date,
        moving through the academic ranks and founding the West
        Chester University Actuarial Science program. She is currently
        Associate Dean for the College of Mathematics and Sciences.
      </p>  
      Within EPADEL, Lisa served in the elected positions
      of Vice Chair, Chair, and Section Representative after a term
      as an at-large member of the EPADEL Executive Committee from
      2005 – 2007. Before that she worked alongside Kate McGivney as
      coordinator of EPADEL Section NExT, including securing some
      funding for joint programming with AMATYC’s Project
      ACCCESS. 
      <p>
        Lisa has the distinction of being in the role of
        Section President when the 2008 By Laws update changed the
        title to Chair, and she was in the role of Section Governor
        when the 2017 MAA By Laws update changed that title to Section
        Representative to MAA Congress. Since 2018 Lisa has sat on the
        MAA Board of Directors in her role as the Chair of the
        Committee on Sections.

        earned his BA in Mathematics from Reed College in 1984, his MA
        and PhD from the University of Connecticut in 1986 and 1993,
        respectively. In 1996 he became an Assistant Professor at the
        DuBois campus of Penn State and joined the Allegheny Mountain
        Section of the MAA where he served in various leadership roles
        between 1996 and 2006 when he moved to Penn State’s Harrisburg
        campus (Capital College). Because Penn State campuses are
        split between two MAA sections this move made him a member of
        the EPADEL section, where he remained for the duration of his
        career.
      </p>
      <p>
        He served on the EPADEL Executive Board as the book table coordinator,
        as a Member-At-Large, Vice Chair, and Chair. He was appointed the
        first Section Historian when that position was created in 2011.

          </aside>      was raised outside of Philadelphia, PA (specifically in the towns of
          Bensalem and Holland). She had to switch schools in her very early
          years and because of inconsistent curricula she learned to add and
          subtract before she learned to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ellen earned her B.S.Ed. from Millersville University in 2002, her
        M.S. from Lehigh University in 2004, and her Ph.D. also from Lehigh in
        2008. From 2008 to 2012 she was an Assistant Professor at Cabrini
        College. In 2012 she accepted a tenure track position at Temple
        University, earning tenure in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ellen served on the EPADEL Executive Board as a Member-At-Larg
        (2011-2017), Vice Chair (2017-2019), and Chair (2019-2021). Her
        predecessor as both Chair and Vice Chair was her former real analysis
        professor at Millersville, Ximena Catepillan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ellen has the dubious and unsought distinction of being the only
        Chair/President of the section never to have stood in front of the
        assembled membership to conduct a meeting.  She became chair just
        prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and had to make the
        heartbreaking decision to take the meeting to a virtual format in the
        spring of 2020. Unfortunately the pandemic coincided almost exactly
        with Ellen’s time as Chair so she was never able to preside over a
        physical meeting of the section.
