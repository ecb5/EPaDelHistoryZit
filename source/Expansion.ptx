  <title>Expansion, <m>1956-1978</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The New Jersey Section was founded as the 27th section of the MAA in
      1956 under the direction of Dean Albert Meder of Rutgers and Albert W.
      Tucker of Princeton, heretofore influential members of the Philadelphia
      Section. From that time onward, all MAA members who lived in the Garden
      State were affiliated with the New Jersey Section. This chapter traces
      developments in the Philadelphia Section from 1956 through 1978. It shows that
      the section continued to prosper in spite of losing a previously vital element.
      Indeed, the section expanded rapidly; its annual meetings attracted record crowds
      and the increasingly broad interests of the membership sparked the inauguration
      of annual spring meetings in addition to annual fall meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the annual meeting in November 1978, the membership passed <q>by an
      overwhelming vote</q> an amendment to the by-laws to change the name of the
      section to reflect the boundary that had been in effect for 22 years. That
      amendment had been moved, seconded, and adopted by the Executive Committee
      at its meeting on April 8 of that year. Beginning with national MAA approval of
      the change on January 2, 1979, the section became known as the Eastern
      Pennsylvania and Delaware Section – in short, EPADEL. Consequently the 23-
      year period covered in this chapter describes the last phase of the Philadelphia
      Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, the chapter begins with an examination of all annual meetings held
      during the period: attendance, dates, and locations. We discuss how the first two
      elements are intimately intertwined. In this chapter the examination of meetings
      is not followed directly by a discussion of the section’s leadership. Instead, we
      describe a whole raft of new activities that were instituted, including high-school
      contests, a committee on teaching standards, a newsletter, a panel on industrial
      opportunities, sessions of undergraduate speakers, results from competitions,
      films, special interest groups, and, most notably, the restructuring of the section’s
      governance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes an account of the new leadership that expanded the types of
      activities the section sponsored. Changes to the by-laws in 1956 and 1968
      materially altered the section’s governance, resulting in an Executive Committee
      to assist the chairman and secretary with administering the section. We provide
      biographical sketches of all 15 section chairs. Profiles of Marguerite Lehr, Will
      Baxter, Doris Schattschneider, and Albert Wilansky appear at the end of the
      chapter to honor contributions that span the section’s 75-year history.
      Biographical sketches of three secretary-treasurers and two other leaders are
      interspersed throughout the text.
      Moreover, changes at the national MAAa
    </p>
    <p>
      led to the institution of a Board of
      Governors in place of the previous Board of Trustees. We examine the history of
      this transformation before looking at the individuals who served as governors.
      Two sectional governors are profiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last part of the chapter concerns the various activities sponsored by the
      section in the 23-year period. In addition to panel discussions, films, and student
      presentations, there were 80 invited lectures. We present a chronological account
      of the lectures and an analysis of the lectures according to their mathematical
      classification. Most activities were concerned with educational and curriculum
      issues. The highest number of invited lectures dealt with analysis and
      topology/geometry but substantial numbers of talks were devoted to algebra/
      number theory, applications, and combinatorics/graph theory as well.

    <title>Annual Meetings</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Table13">Table</xref> provides an overview of the 23 annual meetings of the Philadelphia
      Section held from <m>1956</m> to <m>1978</m>. The final column provides references to the
      official annual reports from the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. We were unable to locate the report
      from the 1978 meeting at Millersville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columns 3, 4, and 5 in <xref ref="Table13">Table</xref> list those attendance figures we were able to
      locate. Although the secretaries’ annual reports listed total attendance (#) and the
      number of attendees who belonged to the MAA, they no longer listed the names
      of MAA members. One salient feature is the dramatic increase in attendance
      beginning with the 1963 meeting. The doubling of local attendance was evident
      at meetings held at Lehigh Valley colleges in 1971 and 1977 too, unlike earlier
      periods when travel difficulties caused relatively low attendance at meetings held
      there. What might explain this extraordinary increase? A reason might be found
      by examining MAA membership levels, but those numbers show only a gradual
      increase from 10,000 in 1960 to 12,800 in 1962, 14,000 in 1963, and 15,600 in
      1964.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what accounts for the sudden doubling of attendance? Focus on the dates
      of the 23 meetings listed in the first column of <xref ref="Table13">Table</xref>, because they betray a
      subtle shift. Beginning in 1963, meeting dates were changed from the Saturday
      after Thanksgiving to the Saturday before, reversing a tradition established
      officially in 1939 but observed unofficially every year since the section’s
      founding in 1926. This change alone accounts for the increase in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second column in <xref ref="Table13">Table</xref> lists the locations of the 23 meetings. Whereas
      in earlier periods the University of Pennsylvania dominated the sites of the
      annual meetings, none was held at Penn from 1955 to 1997. Similarly, Lehigh
      University, the other focus in our elliptical model for the founding of the section,
      hosted only one in the 23-year period, in 1958. Lehigh hosted four meetings
      before this period but would not host another for 40 more years. The examples of
      Penn and Lehigh suggest that beginning in the mid-1950s the section’s leadership
      decentralized from these two research universities to other colleges and
      universities scattered throughout the region. This change in the nature of our
      local section is undoubtedly related to the rapid expansion of faculties in
      departments of mathematics in many colleges and universities throughout the
      country at the time.

    <p>
      Altogether 15 different institutions hosted the 23 meetings. This provides
      another indicator of a broadening of activity, and concomitant with it a
      broadening of the leadership base in the section. Drexel University picked up
      Penn’s slack in the city, hosting three of the fall meetings. Swarthmore College
      was the site of three meetings as well. Four institutions hosted meetings on two
      occasions: the University of Delaware, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Haverford
      College, and West Chester University. The remaining nine institutions hosted one
      meeting each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> reported that the annual meeting was held in Delaware for the first
      time in 1952; it met there again twice in the present period and again in 1980.
      Haverford hosted two meetings in the present period also, and two prior to the
      period, but none since then. The 1962 meeting at Franklin &amp; Marshall marked
      the first time the section met in Lancaster; it would return in 1975 and 1987.
      Similarly, the 1965 meeting at West Chester marked the first time the section met
      at one of Pennsylvania’s state teachers colleges. Today the collection of those
      institutions is called the State System of Higher Education. (The State System of
      Higher Education consists of 14 universities, with eight located in our section:
      Bloomsburg, Cheyney, East Stroudsburg, Kutztown, Mansfield, Millersville,
      Shippensburg, and West Chester). The section also met at West Chester in 1970
      and 1982. Several institutions that hosted one meeting in the present period did
      so for the first time: Millersville University (1978, again in 1989), Muhlenberg
      College (1956 and 1992) and Villanova University (1966 and 1981). Two
      institutions hosted an annual meeting for the only time ever: Lebanon Valley
      College (1972) and Moravian College (1977).
    </p>
    <p>
      All data in the preceding paragraph refer to annual fall meetings. The section
      inaugurated spring meetings in 1976. <xref ref="SpringMeetings">Chapter</xref> supplied details about them
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      One institution’s bid to host an annual meeting during the present period
      serves as a harbinger of a new kind of institutional affiliation. Toward the end of
      the period, in 1976, the section met at Montgomery County Community College
      (MCCC), marking the first time the annual event was held at a community
      college. <xref ref="EPADEL">Chapter</xref> describes several meetings held at two-year institutions.

  <section>
    <title> Activities</title>
    <p>
      During the first 30 annual meetings almost all activity was centered on
      the invited lectures, most of which dealt with strictly mathematical topics.
      However, in the period 1956-1978 the section began to sponsor other activities
      that reflected the broadening of the section’s leadership and interests. Of
      particular importance was the section’s involvement with high school
      mathematics contests and standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter of contests arose at the 1956 meeting when the national MAA’s
      Committee On High School Contests, formed the year before, sought the views
      of all sections on their participation in the National Mathematics Contest for
      High Schools. Our section discussed the issue at the business part of the meeting,
      at which G. Cuthbert Webber briefly described the examination for high school
      students given in Delaware in the spring of 1956 under partial sponsorship of the
      MAA. When the plenary discussion ended, the section adopted the following
      resolution:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
      <em>
        The Philadelphia Section of the Mathematical Association of America
        agrees in principle with the establishment of a National Contest for High
        Schools. The Section believes that considerable autonomy should be left
        with the Sections to determine the particular form of organization most
        suitable for the Section within the national regulations.
      </em>
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      At the meeting held the next year the matter of sectional participation was
      raised again. This time two actions were taken:
      <ol>
        <li> The Philadelphia Section approves in principal [sic] that we participate
        in the Mathematics Contest for high schools in our region.
        </li>
        <li> The chairman shall appoint a committee to work out details with power
        to act for the Association. This committee shall plan to hold these
        contests beginning in March of 1959, and shall decide on methods of
        administration, publication, and awards. It shall, by March 30, 1958,
        submit its recommendations by mail to the entire membership for
        comments.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The section officers appointed a committee to study the matter, with Walter
      Lawton (of Temple) as chairman, and Truman Koehler (Muhlenberg), G.
      Cuthbert Webber (Delaware), Donald Western (F &amp; M), and E. R. Mullins, Jr. (a
      high school teacher) as committee members. The secretary’s report from the
      1959 meeting notes only, <q>Professor Lawton reported on the progress of the High
      School contest conducted in the Philadelphia area.</q> No further details were
      forthcoming. Yet by 1976 the section’s newsletter was informing its readership
      that 550 students from the Philadelphia area were among the 350,000 students
      nationwide who took the 80-minute, multiple-choice exam in March of that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another activity from this period concerned teaching standards, an issue that
      reappeared on the national scene in the 1990s, although standards in the 1950s
      were much different than standards in the 1990s. Once again the secretary’s
      report from the 1959 meeting provides precious little information. F. L. Dennis
      wrote, <q>Professor Lehr reported on the Professional Standards Conference.</q>
      However, Dennis supplied further details in his report from the next meeting,
      writing, <q>At the business meeting Professor J. A. Brown reported on the progress
      of the Committee on Professional Standards.</q> An elaboration of this statement
      reveals that the entire afternoon session was devoted to this theme, beginning
      with a keynote address by Howard Fehr of the Teachers College at Columbia. A
      panel on <q>Professional standards for teachers of mathematics in the school</q>
      followed. B. H. Bissinger (then at Lebanon Valley) moderated the discussion
      along with three participants: Albert Filano (West Chester) and two Philadelphia
      high-school teachers, K. S. Kalman and Joseph Gavin. The panel’s
      recommendations make fascinating reading almost 50 years later. One can only
      wonder what the present state of high school and college mathematics might be if
      the committee’s recommendations had been enacted.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
      <em>
        What teachers must know depends upon the subject matter they will teach.
        What will be taught depends largely on the caliber of scholar that can be
        attracted to the teaching of high school mathematics. On the assumption
        that the high school program will eventually be of the standards shown in
        the SMSG materials, the teachers must have a five-year training period.
        Entrance to the program should demand four years (9-12) of high school
        mathematics study as prerequisite. The four year undergraduate program
        should consist of calculus and analytic geometry, 12 s.h.; algebra
        (polynomial, linear, abstract), 6 s.h.; geometry (affine, Euclidean, vector,
        projective, algebraic), 6 s.h.; probability and statistical inference, 6 s.h.;
        professionalized subject matter, 6 s.h.; methods of teaching and practice
        teaching, 6 s.h. The fifth year should include a 3 to 41⁄2 s.h. course in each
        of the following: (a) higher analysis or function theory; (b) theory of
        numbers; (c) structures, i.e., theory of sets, topology, or vector spaces; (d)
        logic or non-euclidean geometries; (e) applications, i.e., mathematical
        physics, econometrics, game theory, statistical analysis, etc.; and (f)
        history of mathematics. All this should be accompanied by a seminar in
        mathematical education.
      </em>
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      The abbreviation SMSG might not ring a bell for some younger readers. Its
      meaning can be understood from the title of an address presented at the 1959
      meeting by Vincent Haag of Franklin &amp; Marshall College: <q>Work of the School
      Mathematics Study Group at Boulder and Ann Arbor</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of related interest, the following resolution was adopted at the business part
      of the 1959 meeting: <q>Be it resolved that the Philadelphia Section ... direct and
      empower the Executive Committee to take the necessary steps to institute a
      Mathematics Newsletter directed primarily toward the secondary schools of the
      area.</q> However, the proposed newsletter was not mentioned in any subsequent
      reports of sectional activities. The section did initiate a newsletter in 1976, but it
      was (and is) aimed at the entire membership, not some proper subset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all activities that arose in the period 1956-1978 were related to high
      school mathematics. The entire 1958 meeting was devoted to the topic <q>Desirable
      mathematical training for the mathematician who plans to work in industry</q>. The
      impetus for the program came from the section’s chairman, I. Edward Block,
      then at Burroughs Corporation, who was unable to attend the 1958 meeting.
      Lafayette’s Charles Saalfrank presided in his place. The morning session
      consisted of three papers, two of which were delivered by speakers from Bell
      Telephone Laboratories and IBM. The afternoon session consisted of a panel
      discussion moderated by Mina Rees, then at Hunter College but known today
      primarily for her work administering grants for mathematicians from the Office
      of Naval Research. The panelists were Lehigh’s Everett Pitcher and the three
      speakers from the morning session.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of industrial mathematics gave way to other applications at the 1961
      meeting, when two of the three invited speakers lectured on related topics. Both
      hailed from New Jersey, which was no longer part of the Philadelphia Section.
      After the eminent Hans Rademacher began the program with a traditional
      mathematical talk, A. G. Grace of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), then
      located across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, NJ, suggested ALGOL 60 as a
      computer language appropriate for undergraduate mathematics majors. Grace
      said perceptively, <q>the dearth of compilers and the lack of suitable educational
      materials are thought to be vanishing problems.</q> The well-known mathematician
      Henry O. Pollak followed him on the program. Pollak, then associated with Bell
      Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, described the report titled, <q>Recommendations of the
      Panel on Physical Science and Engineering, Committee on the Undergraduate
      Program in Mathematics</q>. The practice of devoting an entire meeting to one
      specific issue occurred several times in the early 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undergraduates appeared on the program at annual meetings for the first time
      in 1962, when one Swarthmore and two Penn students spoke. They were
      followed by James Bartoo, then the chairman of the department at Penn State,
      whose title was <q>Undergraduate mathematics: Problems posed by large
      enrollments</q>. A special session for students featured six 20-minute talks by
      undergraduates at the meeting held in 1974. Similarly, there were three student
      speakers in 1975 and four in 1977.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> described the 1954 session on teaching mathematics using
      television as a prototype for panel discussions. So far this chapter has described
      panels that were held in 1958 and 1960. Panels became all the rage at annual
      meetings after that, with one on every program from 1964 to 1970, except 1967
      (which had none) and 1970 (which had two). <xref ref="Table14">Table</xref> lists all panel discussions

      The 1967 meeting was the first at which the section recognized its top
      performers on the Putnam Competition. Each was awarded a year’s membership
      in the MAA. The report from that meeting states that all three winners hailed
      from Swarthmore, but unfortunately it does not name them. Names of Putnam
      awardees were provided at every meeting up to 1976, but no such reports
      appeared thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meetings in 1956 and 1968 turned out to be critical for the future
      governance of the section. The by-laws had to be rewritten in 1956 to account for
      the loss of New Jersey members, and the section took advantage of the
      opportunity to change its administration. For one thing, it expanded the duties of
      the secretary to include treasurer as well. In addition, an Executive Committee
      was defined as consisting of the chairman, secretary-treasurer, governor, and
      three members-at-large. Thirdly, the relation of the new committee to the former
      program committee was described: <q>The executive committee shall constitute the
      program committee, the senior member being chairman.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      This governance system worked without interruption for 12 years. However,
      the unexpected death of section chair Emil Amelotti on March 3, 1968, midway
      through his second one-year term, showed the need for additional change.
      Amelotti’s illness had prevented him from presiding over the meeting the
      previous fall; secretary-treasurer Voris Latshaw presided in his place. S. S.
      McNeary agreed to fill Amelotti’s remaining term, including presiding at the
      annual meeting held in November 1968. At the business part of the meeting one
      amendment to the by-laws provided for a new position of vice-chairman of the
      section. The vice-chairman would assume the chairmanship should that position
      become vacant (it has not since then); the vice-chairman’s main duty was to plan
      the program for the next annual meeting. Another amendment to the by-laws
      increased the number of Executive Committee members from three to six. Both
      of these changes are still operative today. The section’s by-laws were amended
      again in 1971 to bring them <q>into conformity with the model By-Laws</q>
      suggested by the MAA’s Committee on Sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report from the 1972 meeting mentions the MAA dues structure for the
      first time. It states that at the business meeting, <q>The Section voted to support a
      graduated dues structure for the Mathematical Association of America.</q> Annual
      dues had been set at <m>\$3</m> for the MAA’s first year, <m>1916</m>, but increased to <m>\$4</m> five
      years later. The amount remained at $4 until 1957, leading MAA President Lester
      Ford to quip that the three most famous mathematical constants were <m>e</m>, <m>\pi</m>, and <m>4</m>.
      Dues rose to <m>\$5</m> in 1957 and <m>\$6</m> in 1968. A graduated dues structure has been in
      effect since the mid-1970s.

      An MAA Committee on the Production of Films met from 1958 to 1962,
      when the Committee on Educational Media superseded it. The first time a film
      was shown at one of our section’s meetings was 1966, when George Pólya was
      featured in <q>Let us teach guessing</q>. The following year <q>Fixed points</q> with
      Solomon Lefschetz was shown. The annual meeting in 1974 was special,
      however, for its screening of <q>Rotating polyhedral forms: M. C. Escher with a
      twist</q>. The film’s producer was, not surprisingly, Doris Schattschneider, the
      Escher specialist from Moravian College. No program has featured films since
      that time, although Robert Devaney showed a particularly impressive animated
      segment as part of his 1987 presentation titled <q>Computer graphics experiments
      in complex dynamical systems</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the usual business, two matters occupied most of the
      leadership’s efforts in 1974. One was a questionnaire designed by Eugene Klotz
      to ascertain <q>further information about our constituent institutions, and the
      interests and problems of our colleagues.</q> The initial response was small so
      Klotz sent a gentle reminder to each department in the section that did not
      respond. <q>The questionnaire was not meant to be a formidable task; casual
      estimates, guesses, and even occasional blanks are all quite acceptable
      responses.</q> Yet the follow-up garnered only a few more responses. Klotz
      summarized the results from the sample of 25 departments in a brief memo to a
      committee headed by Dorothy Wolfe called <q>A possible organization of the local
      MAA activities suggested by the questionnaire</q>. The memo stated three
      activities: a newsletter, special meetings, and special topics at regular meetings.
      The latter two areas combined to produce spring meetings, which were first held
      two years later; they are discussed in detail in <xref ref="SpringMeetings">Chapter</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other area took root even sooner, in 1974, when the section broke new
      ground with something called <q>special activities</q>. The chairpersons of these
      special activities presented brief reports at the meeting: <q>applied mathematics</q>
      (Wallace Growney, Susquehanna University), <q>Community colleges</q> (Louis
      Hoelzle, Bucks County Community College), <q>Newsletter</q> (Dorothy Wolfe,
      Widener College), and <q>Visiting lectures</q> (Jerry King, Lehigh University). Some
      of these activities reappeared later in the form of Special Interest Groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the special activities planted in 1974 began to sprout buds the
      following year, when minutes from an Executive Committee meeting stated, <q>We
      agreed to try to get a Newsletter going in the near future. Dorothy Wolfe will
      make the editing attempt and Phil Bedient will look into the production
      problem.</q> A lack of sufficient finances caused a delay in appearance, but the first
      section newsletter was published in February 1976 with Dorothy Wolfe
      (Widener) as editor. Since that time the newsletter has become the section’s
      primary source of communication, especially because, as we will see in <xref ref="EPADEL">Chapter</xref>, by about 1980 the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> discontinued the practice of publishing sectional
      reports. For now we relate two items about the national MAA that appeared in
      the second newsletter (published in October 1976). In that issue the section’s
      governor, David Rosen, wrote, <q>You will also be interested to know that the 1978
      January meeting has been moved to January 6-8 ... the usual late January
      meeting time has become inconvenient for many schools.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosen’s report also mentioned the search for national headquarters. He wrote,
      <q>The Board of Governors authorized the National Executive Committee to move
      along with plans for acquiring a building in Washington as rapidly as possible.
      Paying for this new building should not be a hardship on the membership
      because two members of the Association have pledged substantial amounts of
      money towards this project.</q> The MAA purchased a three-building complex at
      1529 18 th St. NW in Washington in 1978 that has served as the Association’s
      headquarters since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      While David Rosen was assuring the Philadelphia Section membership that no
      sudden increase in dues would be imminent, his colleague, section chair Gene
      Klotz, was playing a different tune locally. Klotz wrote, <q>Our By-Laws prohibit
      charging more than $1.00 registration fee at our fall meeting. We have recently
      taken to inviting speakers from outside the section to our fall meeting and special
      meetings ... It has been recommended that we raise the registration fee (one
      specific figure mentioned was to $3.00.)</q> The by-laws were subsequently
      changed and the registration fee rose to $2.50 at the fall 1977 meeting. For
      comparison’s sake, that fee had increased to $17 ($15 in advance) at the fall 2000
      meeting at Penn State – Abington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visiting lecture program was started about 1970 by the Executive
      Committee, with Phillip Bedient (F&amp;M) in charge of the initial stage. He turned
      the program over to James Brooks (Villanova), under whom the program seemed
      to languish. When Bedient was elected secretary-treasurer he asked Jerry King
      (Lehigh) to take charge. As Brooks had discovered, it was not an easy task.
      However, two years later King wrote, <q>Some twenty members have agreed to
      speak at nearby schools.</q> A list of names and topics was mailed to all
      departments in the section. <xref ref="EPADEL">Chapter</xref> discusses the continuation of this program
      in the next era of the section’s history.
    </p>
    <p>
      A program of institutional representatives was established in 1977 to enhance
      communication with the membership. At that time secretary-treasurer Willard
      Baxter began to send official communications to the representatives, who were
      asked to forward the information to their colleagues. Since not all institutions
      have representatives, secretary-treasurers sometimes rely on department chairs
      for this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the 1970s the emerging role of two-year institutions was being
      felt in the section. In 1977 section chair Gene Klotz wrote, <q>Some members have
      expressed an interest in establishing closer relations with the Pennsylvania State
      Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges.</q> He then appealed for ways to
      meet this challenge.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>Leaders</title>
    <p>
      We mentioned that the section’s governance structure changed dramatically in
      1956 and 1968. These changes are reflected in <xref ref="Table15"> Table</xref>, which lists all officers
      from 1956 to 1978. The section derived great benefits from a cadre of leaders
      during this period, altogether having 15 different chairs in 23 years.
    </p>
<p>    <foreign>Chairs</foreign></p>
    <p>
      Several changes in the chief executive position occurred during the period
      1956-1978. The second column in <xref ref="Table15"> Table</xref> shows that almost all chairs were
      elected for two terms starting with Charles Saalfrank in 1962. This tradition was
      not codified, however. As the section’s newsletter editor Dorothy Wolfe wrote in
      1976, <q>It is customary, although not necessary, to keep the chairperson and vice-
      chairperson in office for two years.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 15 sectional chairs embody a diverse lot. The election of I. Edward Block
      from Burroughs Corporation represented the first time in the section’s history
      that a chair carried a nonacademic affiliation. The only other chief officer to hold
      nonacademic employment has been Walter Stromquist. Because the section no
      longer included New Jersey, it was impossible for chairs to be as geographically
      scattered as before, but when Joerg Mayer of Lebanon Valley College was
      elected in 1973 and 1974 he provided leadership from the section’s northwestern
      region. In a similar vein, the election of Donald Western as the only chairman
      ever to come from Franklin &amp; Marshall College provided leadership from a
      similar part of the section. The University of Delaware continued its tradition of
      leadership when Russell Remage and Willard Baxter were elected for a total of
      four years.

      Although nobody from the University of Pennsylvania was elected chair
      during this period, the city of Philadelphia was home to chairs from other
      academic institutions in the Quaker City for eight of the 23 years. This included
      officers from the Drexel Institute of Technology (McNeary and Pervin) in
      addition to first-time representation from LaSalle (Albright), Temple (Lawton),
      Villanova (Amelotti), and Burroughs (Block). Albright and Amelotti were their
      schools’ only chairs in the section’s 75-year history. Lehr (Bryn Mawr) and
      Klotz (Swarthmore) were the last representatives from their schools to be elected
      chair. Lehr’s election in 1958 followed Bryn Mawr’s Anna Pell Wheeler (1943)
      and John Oxtoby (1955), while Klotz’s elections in 1975 and 1976 made him the
      only other chair from Swarthmore except for Arnold Dresden (1940).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chairs from Lehigh Valley schools presided for five of the 23 years. The
      election of Albert Wilansky in 1958 was the last time that an MAA member from
      Lehigh University was elected chair. However, the elections of Lafayette
      College’s Charles Saalfrank in 1962 and 1963 and Moravian’s Doris
      Schattschneider in 1977 and 1978 show that the Lehigh Valley continued as a
      hub of leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lehr, Schattschneider, and Wilansky are profiled at the end of the chapter. For
      now we provide biographical sketches of the 12 remaining chairs in the order of
      their terms. The position of vice-chairman was created in 1968 when LaSalle’s
      Hugh Albright was the first person elected to the position. Without express
      mention, the title of the position was changed to vice-chairperson when Doris
      Schattschneider was elected in 1975. Correspondingly Gene Klotz was referred
      to as the chairperson. Since every vice-chair became the next chair, there is no
      need to present separate sketches of the vice-chairs. A biographical sketch of the
      final vice-chair in this period, Howard Anton, appears in the next chapter.
      (Several section leaders were involved in the founding and the establishment of
      SIAM – the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics – which has had its
      headquarters in Philadelphia since it was conceived in the fall of 1951.)

        <term>Isaac Edward Block</term> is a native Philadelphian who was born in 1924. He
        received his bachelors degree in physics from Haverford College in 1944.
        He then obtained two degrees from Harvard, an M.S. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in
        1952, both in mathematics with the latter under the famous analyst Joseph
        Walsh. Ed Block was a mathematics consultant for Philco Corporation from
        1951 to 1954. During this time he was a founder of SIAM; he was elected
        its first secretary and served as managing editor of its first journal.
        Subsequently, as a volunteer, he served as chair of the SIAM’s publications
        committee, and eventually as chair of the SIAM board. In 1954 Block
        accepted a position with the computer company Burroughs Corporation as
        manager of its Philadelphia Computer Center. He was employed there when
        elected chair of the Philadelphia Section three years later. Block later
        worked at another computer company, Remington Rand Univac -
        Philadelphia, as manager of its applied mathematics department. Later he
        became a vice-president of Auerbach Publishers, Inc. In 1976 he was
        persuaded to become SIAM’s first full-time managing director, a position he
        held until his retirement in 1994. That same year Block was awarded the
        MAA’s Certificate of Merit, the only person from our section to receive it
        during the section’s first 75 years. The Certificate of Merit is a special
        award given at irregular intervals for some special work or service
        associated with mathematics or the wider mathematical community. Block
        still resides in the Philadelphia area.

<term>Walter S. Lawton</term> was born in 1906 in Mt. Carmel, PA. He received his
        A.B. degree from Temple University in 1929, and then obtained two degrees
        from the University of Pennsylvania: an M.A. in 1930 and a Ph.D. in 1934
        (for a dissertation written under former section chair J. A. Shohat). Lawton
        spent his entire professional career at Temple, from his hiring in 1930 until
        his retirement 40 years later. He served as chair of the department from
        1954 to 1970. During World War II he served his country in the U. S. Naval
        Reserves from 1942 to 1945. He was nominated as chairman of the section’s
        Committee on High School Contests in 1957 and was elected chair of the
        section two years later. The section newsletter reported Temple’s initiation
        of Lawton Lectureships in 1976 to honor his contributions to the University.
        It was cryptically recorded there that <q>Lawton disappeared about six years
        ago at his summer home in the Poconos.</q> He was pronounced dead
        officially in February 1971.

        most of his life in the area. He received a B.S. from Haverford College in
        1936 and an M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania seven years later.
        Sam McNeary was an instructor at the Drexel Institute of Technology from
        1939 until his retirement 1978, except for three years during World War II.
        He introduced Drexel’s first courses in statistics and numerical analysis.
        During the war, from 1943 to 1946, he worked as a design engineer on
        defense-related projects at Westinghouse Corporation in Philadelphia.
        McNeary was a member of the founding group of SIAM in 1951. He was
        Drexel’s representative to SIAM, and he served for several years as an
        editor of the SIAM Newsletter and the SIAM Review. He was elected chair of
        the Philadelphia Section in 1960. He also agreed to assume the
        chairmanship in 1968 when Emil Amelotti passed away midway through his
        second one-year term. McNeary was the author of a calculus text and
        several papers on hydraulics and other engineering projects. After retirement
        he became interested in home renovations and bought, refurbished, and sold
        a dozen houses. McNeary died after suffering a stroke in suburban
        Philadelphia three months shy of his <m>83</m>rd birthday.

<term> Donald Ward Western</term> (1915-2003) was born in Poland, New York. He
        obtained a bachelors degree from Denison University in 1937, a masters
        degree from Michigan State University in 1939, and a Ph.D. from Brown
        University in 1946 for a dissertation on integral norms written under Paul
        Rosenbloom and Jacob Tamarkin. Western joined the faculty at Franklin &amp;
        Marshall College two years after receiving his doctorate, remaining there
        until he retired in 1980. During that time he served as chair of the
        department for 20 years, 1952-1972. He was elected to the section’s
        Executive Committee for a three-year term in 1957, the same year that he
        was appointed to the committee on high school contests. He was active in
        the Philadelphia Section in several other ways – serving on the Program
        Committee 1952-1953, being elected chair for 1961-1962, being elected
        sectional governor for 1962-1965, and being a panelist at meetings held in
        1966 and 1972. Western was an NSF faculty fellow in 1960. He still resides

        University of Nevada two years later. He then returned to Penn as an
        instructor from 1943 to 1947, all the while completing requirements for the
        doctorate. He was awarded the Ph.D. the next year for a dissertation written
        under A. D. Wallace, the first of 22 that Wallace directed. Saalfrank taught
        at Franklin &amp; Marshall during the 1947-1948 academic year but then left for
        Rutgers University. He remained at Rutgers from 1948 to 1952, and then
        crossed the Delaware River again to accept a professorship and become
        chair of the department at Lafayette College, where he spent the rest of his
        career. Saalfrank was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1962 and
        1963. Amazingly, he was chair of the mathematics department for 30 years,
        1952-1982. Charlie Saalfrank retired from Lafayette in 1986. Since then, his

<term>Russell Remage, Jr.</term> (1915-2001) was born in West Virginia. By age 21 he
        had earned bachelors and masters degrees from West Virginia University, an
        A.B. in 1936 and an A.M. in 1937. Four years later he was commissioned in
        the Navy, where, at age 25, he became one of the youngest commanding
        officers in World War II. Following the war, Russ Remage accepted an
        instructorship at the University of Delaware in 1946. Over the next four
        years he juggled teaching duties, raising three daughters, and graduate
        studies at the University of Pennsylvania, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1950 for a
        dissertation on invariance and periodicity of transformations written under
        G. Schweigert. He remained on the Newark campus until his retirement in
        February 1981. The year 1964 was particularly propitious for Remage – he
        was promoted to professor, selected department chairman, and elected chair
        of the Philadelphia Section. He remained as chair of the section for a pair of
        one-year terms and chair of his department for six years. During this time he
        took the lead in establishing the department’s Ph.D. program. Remage and
        his Delaware colleague Robert Jackson served as co-editors of the SIAM’s
        first journal at its start in 1953. He held an NSF faculty fellowship for the
        year 1959-1960. An athlete throughout his life, Remage remained an avid
        tennis player in retirement; inspired by Tiger Woods, he took up golf at age
        81. He died on May 23, 2001 at the age of 85.

        department at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee for three years
        before moving to Drexel University in 1967. He directed doctoral theses at
        Penn State and Wisconsin. William J. Pervin participated in the section as
        soon as he came to the area, delivering an invited address at the November
        1967 annual meeting on <q>Algebraic topology for undergraduates</q>. When he
        was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1972, he was in the midst of
        a two-year stint as Director of the Computing Center at Drexel. Pervin was
        the section’s last chair to hold the position for only one year. He has worn
        various mantels at the University of Texas at Dallas since leaving Drexel in
        1973, mostly in computing. However, Pervin steadfastly maintained his
        professorship in the department of mathematics and computer science,
        serving as chair of the department from 1983 to 1985 and master of the
        Engineering School (1987-1994). He resides in Richardson, Texas, with his
        wife and 12-year-old daughter.

<term> Joerg Werner Peter Mayer</term> was born in 1929 in Germany. He received his
        advanced degrees at Universität Gießen, with a 1954 doctorate based on a
        dissertation written under A. Peyerimhoff. He taught at the University of
        Malaysia 1954-1957. Mayer then came to the University of New Mexico,
        where he directed six Ph.D. students. He left New Mexico in 1968 to
        become chair of the department at George Mason University in Virginia.
        However, two years later Mayer found an area much more to his liking and
        moved to Lebanon Valley College, where he remained until his retirement
        in 1997. He served as chair of the department 1970-1982 and as director of
        the new computer center 1973-1975. Mayer discussed his chairing of our
        section and the MD-VA-DC section in a 1982 MAA invited lecture titled,
        <q>Reflections of a maverick chairman</q>. He is the author of two books,
        Algebraic Topology (1972) and Assembly Language Programming (1991).
        Although he has a daughter and four sons, he is not related to Jörg-Peter
        Mayer, who received a doctorate from Universität Kiel in 1997. Our Mayer
        has lived in Brattleboro, VT, since his retirement.

<term> Eugene Arthur Klotz</term> was born in Iowa in 1935. He received a B.S. from
        Antioch College in 1958 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1965 for a dissertation on
        Lie rings written under the famous algebraist Nathan Jacobson. Gene Klotz
        came to Swarthmore College in 1963 and has remained there ever since. In
        1971 he published the book Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry with
        former section chair Heinrich W. Brinkmann. Klotz was an associate
        professor when elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1975 and 1976,
        but was promoted to full professor the following year. He was an NSF
        Science Faculty Fellow in 1974 and the principal investigator for a 1981-
        1982 NSF grant on mathematical education using information technology.
        His interests shifted to computers and mathematics during the 1980s, and he
        was one of the founders of the Math Forum on the Internet that has garnered
        international acclaim.

      Earlier we noted the waning influence of the University of Pennsylvania on
      sectional leadership. This can be seen in the sketches of the 15 different chairs in
      the period, none of whom was on the faculty at Penn. However, <xref ref="Table16">Table</xref>, which
      lists the doctorate granting university for the 13 chairs who received a Ph.D.,
      reflects Penn’s continuing influence in a different light. It shows that 5 of the 13
      (or 38%) received their Ph.D. from Penn. Indeed 10 (77%) received their highest
      degrees from Ivy League institutions. Moreover, we will see below that Penn
      continued to produce the greatest number of invited speakers of any institution.

    <p><foreign> Secretary-Treasurers</foreign></p>
    <p>
      Let us review briefly the history of the position of secretary-treasurer of the
      section. At the organizational meeting in 1926 one of the founders, Albert
      Bennett (Lehigh), was elected as vice-chairman and secretary-treasurer. The next
      year the title <q>vice-chairman</q> was dropped when J. R. Kline (Penn) was elected
      secretary-treasurer. In 1928 the designation <q>treasurer</q> was dropped when P. A.
      Caris of Penn was elected as secretary. The secretary then resided at the
      University of Pennsylvania until 1947, with Perry Caris serving a record 13 years
      from 1928 to 1941. The present period began with G. Cuthbert Webber
      (Delaware) at the helm; he was elected to the post at meetings held from 1953
      through 1957. As previously noted in this chapter, the by-laws were changed in
      1956 to return the position of secretary-treasurer.
    </p>
    <p>The section owes a great debt of gratitude to every secretary-treasurer. During
    the 23-year period under discussion only six individuals held the position. Two
    of them were profiled in <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> – G. C. Webber and F. L. Dennis (Ursinus).
    Willard Baxter (Delaware) is profiled below. Here we provide biographical
    sketches of the three remaining secretary-treasurers, who were associated with
    Lehigh, West Chester, and F &amp; M, in the order of their terms.

<term>Voris V. Latshaw</term> (1903-1988) was born, raised, and educated in Indiana.
        He received all three of his degrees from Indiana University, an A.B. in
        1927, A.M. in 1928, and Ph.D. in 1930. After spending a year as acting head
        of the department at Fort Hays (Kansas) State College, he accepted a
        position at Lehigh University and spent his entire career there. During
        World War II he took leave to serve as a mathematician with the National
        Advisory Committee on Aeronautics from 1944 to 1946. He was the
        secretary-treasurer of the Philadelphia Section during the period 1961-1967 when the MAA celebrated its 50 th anniversary (in 1965). Part of the
        celebration called for a history of MAA sections, a task that fell to Latshaw.
        His account of the first 40 years of the section appeared in the resulting
        book, Kenneth O. May (ed.), The Mathematical Association of America: Its
        First Fifty Years, MAA, 1972, pp. 94-95. Latshaw died in Delray Beach,
        Florida, at the age of 84.

<term> Albert E. Filano</term> was born in Penfield, PA, in 1925. He received two
        degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, a B.S. in 1948 and an M.A.
        the following year. He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics education from
        Penn State in 1954. Filano taught at several colleges before settling at West
        Chester State College in 1958. He served as chairman of the department
        from his appointment until 1969; from 1967 to 1969 he also was the director
        of the college’s Division of Science and Mathematics. Filano then became
        the vice president for academic affairs, a position he held until his
        retirement. During his tenure he also served as acting president of the
        college. Filano has written several texts and workbooks, and he was the
        principal investigator on several NSF grants. He was awarded the Four
        Chaplains Legion of Honor Service Award, the Pennsylvania Council of
        Teachers of Mathematics Outstanding Leader Award, the Outstanding
        Alumnus Award from the Bennetts Valley Alumni Association, and the
        Outstanding Educators of America Award. Filano still resides in West

<term> Phillip E. Bedient</term> was born in China in 1922. He received an A.B. from
        Park College in 1943 and then two degrees from the University of Michigan,
        an M.A. in 1946 and a Ph.D. in 1959. His doctoral dissertation was written
        under the well-known author of differential equations texts, Earl Rainville.
        Between the latter two degrees he taught at Juniata College from 1950 to
        1955. He then moved to Michigan as an instructor. After receiving his
        doctorate Bedient accepted a position at Franklin &amp; Marshall College and
        remained there until his retirement in 1987. He served as chairman of the
        department from 1972 to 1981. He still resides in Lancaster.

</p>
    <p><foreign>Executive Committee</foreign></p>

    <p>
      The Program Committee evolved into the Executive Committee in 1956 and
      expanded 12 years later. From that time onward, the committee was composed of
      six at-large members, each serving a three-year term, with two new members
      elected every year. It became customary to fill the three new slots that were
      added to the committee in 1968 with members associated with a two-year
      institution, a high school, and a nonacademic employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also became customary for leading members of the Executive Committee to
      ascend to higher ranks of sectional governance. Thus, for example, David Rosen
      became governor of the section, Albert Filano secretary-treasurer, and Gerald
      Porter governor and treasurer of the national MAA. It is worthwhile to note that two women were elected to the Executive Committee in 1971 – Marie Wurster of
      Temple University and Claire Tuckman of Cheltenham High School. (Tuckman
      directed many successful problem-competition teams). Another woman was
      elected the next year, Dorothy Wolfe, chair of the department at PMC (now
      Widener University).
    </p>
    <p>
      One amusing incident related to the Executive Committee shows diligence at
      the national level. It was reported to the MAA that at the 1962 annual meeting
      Shaylor Wood of Abington Senior High School was elected to the committee.
      The Executive Director Harry Gehman wrote, <q>According to our records, Mr.
      Wood is not a member of the Association and is, therefore, ineligible to hold
      office. We have, however, invited Mr. Wood to become a member.</q> Only then
      did Gehman notice that the name in the report sent by sectional secretary Voris
      Latshaw differed from the name in his account of the annual meeting. Two days
      later Gehman sent a letter to J. Shaylor Woodruff that began, <q>If you receive a
      letter addressed to Shaylor Wood inviting you to become a member of the
      Association, please ignore the letter.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Too many different individuals served three-year terms to warrant
      biographical sketches and, as far as we know, none but Woodruff was involved
      in a noteworthy incident. However, we introduce Wurster here to honor her
      widespread contributions to the section and to cite important connections with
      earlier section leaders.

      <li> <idx><h>Biographical Sketch</h><h>Wurster, Marie Anna</h></idx>
<term>Marie Anna Wurster</term> was born in Philadelphia in 1918. After attending
      public schools in the city, she entered Bryn Mawr College in 1936 at the
      height of the depression. A scholarship enabled her to live on campus during
      her final two years. Wurster remained at Bryn Mawr as a graduate assistant
      1941-1943, taking all her courses from three other sectional leaders – Anna
      Pell Wheeler, Marguerite Lehr, and John Oxtoby. Then she accepted a
      fellowship to the University of Chicago. During her three years in the
      Windy City she was very active with the Junior Mathematical Club, serving
      on the Executive Committee and presenting a paper on Fourier coefficients
      her first year, being elected social chair the second year, and elected chair
      the final year. She also completed her dissertation (under Lawrence Graves)
      in 1946 on the calculus of variations. Upon graduation she accepted an
      instructorship at Temple University and remained there until retirement in
      1985. She is the author of a textbook with Thomas H. Slook and two with
      the current chair at Temple, John J. Schiller.

    <title>Governors</title>
    <p>
      Although the section’s administrative structure changed dramatically at the
      annual meeting in 1968, actions taken at the national level 30 years earlier
      resulted in another change in the section’s governance. Because this change has
      turned out to be so important for our section, we pause to look at its history. To
      our knowledge, no such account of the history of MAA governors exists
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1938 many of the leaders of the national MAA had become concerned
      about the tenuous relationship between the MAA and its sections, so the Trustees
      appointed a Committee to Review the Activities of the Association. The
      Committee reported its findings in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> two years later. The Trustees
      subsequently accepted the report and discharged the committee with
      appreciation. Its five recommendations provided the most extensive analysis of
      the structure and operations of the MAA since its founding in 1915. One of those
      recommendations replaced the Trustees with the now familiar Board of
      Governors that administered and controlled all scholarly and scientific activities
      of the Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Board’s membership was composed of six national officers, a set of six
      governors elected at large, and a set of 14 governors elected by region. Initially
      two MAA members with ties to our section were elected governors at large –
      Arnold Dresden (Swarthmore) and the section’s founder, A. A. Bennett (Brown).
      The term for governors at large was three years, so two governors were elected
      annually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal change to this organizational scheme, however, concerned the
      regional governors. The Committee to Review the Activities of the Association
      acknowledged the vital role that the MAA sections played. Their report stated,
      <q>The Sections are ... vital and active and have a conscious and definite purpose
      ... [yet] the inter-relation between the Sections and the Association as a central
      body is tenuous almost to the point of non-existence.</q> Hence the report
      recommended the creation of 14 regions, each to elect one governor for a term of
      two years. Region 3 consisted of four states: Delaware, New Jersey,
      Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The first governor elected from the region was
      Frederick W. Owens, who, as we have seen, had been an active member of the
      section even after Penn State was formally associated with the Allegheny Section
      in 1933. His term ran from 1941 to 1943. Owens was succeeded by Arnold
      Dresden for 1943-1945. The next regional governor, L. L. Dines (Carnegie
      Institute of Technology), had no ties to our section. His term was 1945-1947.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the regional setup turned out to be unnecessarily cumbersome, so in
      1945 the Board of Trustees began to phase out the system of regional governors
      in favor of a system of sectional governors serving three-year terms. The first
      governor elected from the Philadelphia Section was Emory P. Starke, who, as we
      have seen, had been an active member of the section from Rutgers. His term ran
      from July 1, 1947, to June 30, 1950, which overlapped his 1947-1948 term as
      chairman of the section. The term of the second sectional governor, George E.
      Raynor, came on the heels of his year as chairman of the Philadelphia Section in
      1948-1949. Raynor’s successor, Cletus Oakley, began 11 years after he
      completed his one-year chairmanship of the Philadelphia Section. Incidentally,
      A. E. Meder (Rutgers) was elected as the first sectional governor of the newly
      formed New Jersey Section in 1955.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Table17">Table</xref> provides the complete list of sectional governors up to 1980. During
      the present period of expansion these governors assumed an even greater role in
      sectional administration as well as serving as liaisons with the national MAA.

      Many of these sectional governors have already been profiled for other
      contributions made to the section. Here we provide sketches of the last two
      governors in <xref ref="Table17">Table</xref> to honor their continuous involvement with the section right
      on up to the present time.

      <li>
<idx><h>Biographical Sketch</h><h>Rosen, David</h></idx>
        <term>David Rosen</term> (1921-2003) was born in New Haven, Connecticut,. He
        received an A.B. from New York University in 1942 and then two degrees
        from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1952
        (for a dissertation written under Joseph Lehner). Rosen was an assistant
        instructor at Penn during his last three years of graduate study. In 1955 he
        accepted a position at Swarthmore College, replacing Arnold Dresden, the
        former section chair who had just retired. Rosen remained at Swarthmore
        until his retirement in 1987. He was an NSF faculty fellow in 1961-1962
        and a Fulbright Professor in Ireland in 1971-1972. Rosen served the section
        in two official capacities, as a member of the Executive Committee 1960-
        1963 and as governor 1974-1977. His volunteer activity in sectional affairs
        was inspired by Arnold Dresden; Rosen in turn was responsible for the
        involvement of Jerry Porter. Rosen resides in Swarthmore. Although he
        continues to play the bass in the college orchestra, he is no longer able to
        play his favorite sport, tennis.
      </li>
<li>
      <idx><h>Biographical Sketch</h><h>King, Jerry Porter</h></idx>
<term> Jerry Porter King</term> was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee, in 1935. He took all
      his degrees from the University of Kentucky, a B.S. in electrical engineering
      in 1958 followed by two degrees in mathematics, an M.S. in 1959 and a
      Ph.D. in 1962. In <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> we noted that King’s thesis advisor, V. F.
      Cowling, taught at Lehigh University from 1949 to 1961 before moving to
      the University of Kentucky. Jerry King was one of Cowling’s first doctoral
      students at Kentucky, and Cowling must have retained sufficiently cordial
      relations with the Lehigh administration, because he recommended his
      student to the Bethlehem school. The fit was perfect, and King has been at
      Lehigh since accepting that first position in 1962. Between 1966 and 1984 he produced nine Ph.D. students, two of whom have been active in sectional
      activities – Frederick (<q>Fritz</q>) Hartmann (1968) and Deborah Frantz (1984).
      King also served in two high-ranking administrative capacities, associate
      dean of the College of Arts and Sciences 1979-1981 and dean of the
      graduate school 1981-1987. In addition, he has served the section in
      numerous ways: as director of the program of visiting lectures (1974),
      member of the Executive Committee 1973-1776, director of the program for
      student speakers (1977), and governor 1977-1980. Besides that, King
      presented two invited lectures, in 1981 and 1997; he also delivered invited
      addresses at three other MAA sections: Kentucky in 1981, Allegheny in
      1995, and New Jersey in 1997. He resides in Bethlehem.
</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      The 1945 change in the MAA’s by-laws also prescribed that two at-large
      governors would be elected triennially from the national membership. Four
      members of the section were elected to those positions up to 1978: Carl B.
      Allendoerfer (Haverford) 1949-1951, Albert W. Tucker (Princeton) 1953-1956,
      Heinrich W. Brinkman (Swarthmore) 1955-1957, and Hans Rademacher (Penn)
      1962-1964. All four at-large governors were profiled in earlier chapters.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>Presenters</title>
    <p>
      The Philadelphia Section sponsored three forms of professional activity
      during the period 1956-1978 that were quite different from any before: films,
      panel discussions, and student contributed-paper sessions. We already discussed
      the three films that were shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether there were 12 panel discussions involving 39 panelists in the 23-
      year period. Five panelists appeared twice: Barnard Bissinger (1960, 1970),
      Albert Filano (1960, 1965), David Rosen (1964, 1966), Benjamin Volker (1969,
      1975), and Donald Western (1966, 1972). Because the topics of many panels
      dealt with pre-college mathematics, it is not surprising that among the 39
      panelists, eight came from two-year institutions and six from high schools. Four
      of the remaining 25 panelists came from outside the area: Brown, Colgate,
      Columbia, and Hunter. From our section, four of the 21 panelists were affiliated
      with Franklin &amp; Marshall, while five institutions were home to two panelists:
      Delaware, Drexel, Lehigh, Swarthmore, and West Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program for the 1962 meeting included student speakers for the first time.
      At the time two students from Penn and one from Swarthmore were listed as part
      of the usual program. Apparently that program was not deemed successful
      because students were not part of any program for another 12 years. In 1974
      there was a special session of 20-minute contributed papers at which six students
      from a number of schools spoke (two from Swarthmore and one each from
      Villanova, Delaware, Moravian, and even Princeton). The topics ranged from
      calculus to graph theory to computer programming. Special sessions were also
      held in 1975, when three papers were presented (by students from Muhlenberg,
      Swarthmore, and Lafayette) and in 1977, when four papers were presented (by
      students from Temple, Muhlenberg, Shippensburg, and Delaware). The success
      of the program of student speakers hid the difficulty of attracting students to
      present their work in such a public forum. The head of the program, Jerry King,
      hinted at the underlying problem in his report from the fall of 1977, when he
      wrote, <q>There’s been a problem in the past in getting volunteers for student talks,
      although those that have been given have been appreciated.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, invited lectures continued to be the mainstay of sectional activity,
      with 80 invited lectures being given from 1956 to 1978. After discussing the
      lecturers and their affiliations, we analyze the lectures in two ways, a
      chronological tour and mathematical classification. The complete list of lecturers
      and the titles of their talks is given in an appendix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether 70 different lecturers account for the 80 invited talks, a number
      that clearly indicates a wide mix of invited speakers. It also attests to the
      oratorical skill of those few individuals who were invited to speak a second time.
      With that in mind, what can one say about the two mathematicians who were
      invited three times? One can say that H. O. Pollak (of Bell Labs in 1961 and
      1965, and as president of the MAA in 1975) and Albert Wilansky (of Lehigh,
      who spoke in 7-year cycles: 1956, 1963, and 1970) not only were captivating
      speakers but that the mathematical topics they investigated were of interest to a
      large number of MAA members in the section. It was noted in <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter</xref> that
      Wilansky delivered the most lectures to the section, five. The six speakers who
      were invited twice in the present period were Frederick Cunningham (Bryn
      Mawr), Samuel Gulden (Lehigh), Edwin Moise (Institute for Advanced Study
      and Michigan), David Rosen (Swarthmore), Isaac Schoenberg (Penn), and
      Herbert Wilf (Penn). Recall that overall both Schoenberg and Wilf accepted four
      invitations to speak at the section’s annual meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Institutional affiliations are as diverse as the speakers, with 18 institutions
      accounting for the 80 lecturers. Once again the University of Pennsylvania led
      the way with 14, followed by Lehigh University and Princeton University (7
      each), Bell Labs and Swarthmore College (4 each), Bryn Mawr College and Penn
      State (3 each), and the University of Delaware, Drexel University, and New York
      University (2 each). It is notable that even though the section’s boundaries no
      longer included New Jersey or central Pennsylvania, seven speakers came from
      Princeton and three from Penn State. It is also notable that whereas heretofore
      few speakers were invited from outside the area, there were so many after 1956
      that we do not bother to single them out. Academic diversity amongst invited
      speakers is reflected in a different way, because three of them were high school
      teachers and nine held nonacademic affiliations at the time of their lecture. From
      the latter set, four came from Bell Labs and one each from the Bureau of
      Standards, General Motors, IBM, American Cyanamid, and the Department of
      Public Instruction. The last affiliation is reminiscent of the program at the
      organizational meeting in 1926 when the final speaker was J. A. Foberg, the State
      Director of Science and Mathematics for Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we take a brief chronological tour of the lectures from 1956 to 1978. The
      first meeting in this period was taken up with four invited lectures, one of which
      was given by Edwin Moise of Harvard with the same title as the talk he delivered
      in 1964, <q>How to tell that a simple overhand knot is really knotted</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two talks at the 1957 meeting by Albert W. Tucker (Princeton) and David
      Rosen (Swarthmore) discussed aspects of high school mathematics. Tucker
      reported on a list of recommendations made by the Commission of Mathematics
      of the College Entrance Examination Board, while Rosen described a course he
      had designed for, and taught to, teachers taking part in an NSF summer institute.
      Two years later the concern for the preparation of high school teachers arose
      again when Vincent Haag of Franklin &amp; Marshall reported on the recent progress
      of SMSG and M. A. Linton, a teacher at the William Penn Charter School in
      Philadelphia, discussed <q>Liaison problems in collegiate mathematics today –
      With the high school</q>. JoAnne Growney (Bloomsburg) wrote a two-page
      editorial in the section’s fall 1978 newsletter addressing the issues that Linton
      raised 20 years earlier. The unusually long title of the editorial provides a good
      synopsis of its content: <q>QUESTION: How can colleges and universities enroll
      students with better mathematical preparation? ANSWER: Work with elementary
      and secondary schools to improve programs there.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also at the 1957 meeting Penn’s Bernard Epstein examined the undergraduate
      curriculum in his lecture, <q>College mathematics for the prospective graduate
      student</q>. The fact that Epstein spoke on an educational theme, which differs
      markedly from the analytic functions he examined in invited lectures at annual
      meetings in 1950 and 1951, shows the extent to which deep concerns with
      educational issues had penetrated the local mathematical establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the three invited speakers at the 1961 meeting supplied viewpoints
      from industry. A. G. Grace recommended ALGOL 60 as a programming
      language appropriate for the undergraduate mathematics curriculum, while H. O.
      Pollak reported on recommendations from the CUPM Panel on Physical Sciences
      and Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1963 Cletus Oakley (Haverford) presented a history of the <q>revolution in
      mathematics</q> since 1955. Based on these developments the former section chair
      predicted, <q>College algebra and analytic geometry as college courses are on the
      way out. The first two years of college mathematics for most liberal arts students
      is, or will be very shortly, calculus and linear algebra. And sooner than you think,
      students will enter college with a solid year of high school calculus.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1964 meeting began with an Edwin Moise lecture bearing the same title
      as a talk he gave eight years earlier. Princeton probabilist William Feller
      followed Moise. He spoke on exactly the same topic as his 1955 talk –
      differential operators – only this time he gave an intrinsic characterization of
      second order differential operators on the line. Once again there was no mention
      of probability in the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. V. Latshaw’s report from the 1965 meeting reads, <q>At the business meeting
      R. L. Wilder read the names of six charter members of MAA now affiliated with
      the Philadelphia Section.</q> However, the report does not list the six names. An
      examination of the MAA’s list of charter members has turned up four who lived
      within the section’s boundaries in 1965. Two resided in the area when they
      joined the MAA in 1915 – Joseph B. Reynolds and William M. Smith. In
      addition, George E. Raynor lived in the state of Washington, while Anna Pell
      (later Anna Pell Wheeler) lived in Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the 1966 meeting Preston Hammer, the first head of the new computer
      science department at Penn State, lectured on a purely mathematical subject.
      Samuel Gulden of Lehigh, who took the audience on <q>A brief trip through the
      affine plane</q>, followed him on the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1967 meeting began with the first of Herbert Wilf’s four talks to the
      section. This time the Steele Prize recipient from Penn spoke on <q>Counting finite
      graphs</q>. Two speakers who would later become section officers, James Brooks
      of Villanova and William Pervin of Drexel, followed him on the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendance of 165 at the 1968 meeting at Drexel smashed the previous
      record (115 at the 1954 meeting in Princeton) but the new record would be short
      lived – the 225 who attended the 1970 meeting at West Chester eclipsed it. The
      1969 meeting at Swarthmore was also well attended (194), but it was the
      program that day that deserves mention. The morning session began with a
      lecture by Moore School topologist Gail Young titled <q>Topological methods in
      analysis</q>. Next came Eric Wolman of Bell Labs who discussed applications in
      communication systems as <q>an application of topological methods</q>. After the
      audience dined in Swarthmore’s student center, the famous mathematician L. J.
      Mordell from Cambridge regaled the assembly with memories he titled
      <q>Reminiscences of an octogenarian mathematician</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program at the 1970 meeting was typical of many that were held at the
      time. It started with a national figure discussing his specialty, this time Victor
      Klee on geometry. Then local favorite Albert Wilansky (Lehigh) answered the
      question, <q>What is an FK space?</q> The afternoon session consisted of two panel
      presentations. The first one, on the place of computers in the mathematics
      curriculum, featured two emerging section leaders, Gerald Porter of Penn and
      Carl Leinbach of Gettysburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      One panelist at the 1972 meeting at Lebanon Valley College, Charles
      Hofmann of LaSalle, subsequently became the section’s newsletter editor (along
      with his wife, Roseanne). A notable speaker at the that meeting was Haskell
      Curry, who had addressed the section 30 years earlier while on leave from Penn
      State at the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia. Curry’s talk on the foundations of
      mathematics was the only lecture on this subject during the present 23-year
      period.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <idx><h>Biographical Sketch</h><h>Curry, Haskell Brooks</h></idx>
<term>Haskell Brooks Curry</term> (1900-1982) was David Hilbert’s last American
        student, receiving his Göttingen doctorate in 1930. He taught at his alma
        mater, Harvard, and at Princeton in the 1920s before accepting a position at
        Penn State in 1929. Except for World War II stints at the Frankford Arsenal
        (1942-1944), Applied Physics Lab (Johns Hopkins, 1944-1945), and
        Aberdeen Proving Ground (1945-1946), Curry spent the rest of his career at
        Penn State. In 1960 the University awarded him its prestigious Evan Pugh Research Professorship, which he held until his retirement six years later.
        Instead of remaining in State College he moved to Amsterdam as director of
        the Institute for Foundational Research; he retired from that post in 1970.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>Two of the invited speakers at the meeting in 1973 later played active roles in
    the section, Marialuisa McAllister (Moravian) and David Rosen (Swarthmore). A
    speaker of national reputation on the program was Martin Davis of New York
    University.
    </p>
    <p>
      James England, then a Swarthmore mathematician and later a provost there
      and at Temple, opened the 1974 meeting at Swarthmore College. He was
      followed by two regular contributors to sectional activities, Herman Gluck
      (Penn) and Frederick Cunningham (Bryn Mawr). Doris Schattschneider
      (Moravian) showed her film at the end of the day. What a way to end a great
      program conducted entirely by local talent!
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1976 meeting at Montgomery County Community College included two
      talks by section members whose affiliations reflect the academic (two-year
      institution) and geographic (northeast Pennsylvania) broadening of the section.
      The host school’s Samuel Plotkin spoke about applications of group theory,
      though that topic might not be evident from his theatrical title, <q>The sound of
      music</q>. The day began with a talk by John Koch of Wilkes College titled <q>The
      proof of the four color theorem</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doris Schattschneider led off the 1977 meeting with a lecture on tiling. She
      was followed by Stephen Shatz (Penn), who spoke about algebraic curves. The
      afternoon concluded with a talk by William Thurston (Princeton) simply titled
      <q>Symmetry</q>. That talk was delivered five years before Thurston received the
      Fields Medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three speakers on the final program in the present period reflect the
      diversity of affiliations and topics seen at many sectional meetings. Dorothy
      Bernstein (Goucher College), the president-elect of the MAA, began the day with
      a lecture on applications. After lunch Chris Rorres (Drexel) also spoke about
      applications. In between the graph theorist Thomas Saaty presented an address
      titled, <q>Priorities, hierarchies, and behavioral systems</q>. Saaty was affiliated with
      Penn’s renowned Wharton School of Business.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>Themes of Lectures</title>
    <p>
      We end the chapter with a brief analysis of the mathematical classification of
      the lectures sponsored by the Philadelphia Section at annual meetings from 1956
      to 1978. Although the leading choice of categories by the speakers during this
      period continued to be analysis, topology emerged as the leading contender. The
      present period also saw seven talks on applications and five on algebra. Because
      strict classification is impossible, the interested reader is urged to consult the
      <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> reports listed in <xref ref="Table13">Table</xref>.
    </p>

    <p><foreign>Analysis</foreign></p>
    <p>
      No longer was the Penn School of Analysis responsible for the continued
      dominance of talks on analysis. In fact, Penn faculty gave only three of the 14
      talks in this category. I. J. Schoenberg gave two – <q>Mass distributions on the
      circle and convex conformal maps</q> (1957) and <q>On spline interpolation</q> (1963).
      N. J. Fine gave the other, <q>Integrability of continuous functions</q> (1963). The
      most popular topic in analysis was differential equations, which was chosen by
      Solomon Lefschetz (in 1960), William Feller (1964), J. P. Diaz (1968), and Louis
      Nirenberg (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
      Local speakers whose lectures mainly dealt with topics in analysis were
      Albert Wilansky, <q>On the Cauchy criterion for the convergence of an infinite
      series</q> (1956), G. A. Stengle, <q>Some asymptotic problems in analysis</q> (1962),
      Frederick Cunningham, <q>Arzela’s theorem</q> (1963) and <q>In search of a modern
      understanding of differentials</q> (1974), and James England, <q>Bernoulli processes
      after the isomorphism theorem</q> (1974).
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously the 14 talks on analysis dealt neither with complex variables nor
      with numerical analysis.
    </p>
    <p><foreign>Geometry/Topology</foreign></p>
    <p>
      What caused the sudden upsurge of interest in topology? Two of the section’s
      leaders were perhaps responsible – William Pervin and Albert Wilansky.
      Wilansky spoke twice (in 1963 and 1970), Pervin once (1967). Besides, three
      MAA officers, all prominent members of the R. L. Moore School of Topology at
      Texas, accepted invitations address the section: R. L. Bing, Raymond Wilder,
      and Gail Young. None dealt with the logical relations among axioms popularized
      by their famous mentor. Instead Bing’s title was <q>Homogeneity,</q> Wilder’s
      <q>Intuition</q> (probably in algebraic geometry), and Young’s <q>Topological methods
      in analysis</q>. The section also heard Edwin Moise speak twice on knot theory.
      William Thurston delivered a notable lecture on topology titled simply
      <q>Symmetry</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman Gluck gave yet another notable lecture on topology in 1974, when he
      stated that Cauchy’s rigidity problem was still open. Just four years later Gluck’s
      Ph.D. student, Robert Connelly, then at Cornell, announced his solution of the
      problem. The paper containing the counterexample Connelly constructed was
      subsequently published in the Journal of I.H.E.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman R. Gluck had obtained his Ph.D. in 1961 at Princeton under the
      legendary Ralph Fox for a dissertation on embedding 2-spheres in 4-spheres.
      Recall that Fox had spoken to the section at annual meetings in 1945 and 1953.
      As of this year Gluck has supervised seven doctoral dissertations at Penn, where
      he has taught since 1966.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five lectures on geometry combined with the 12 on topology make the
      geometry/topology classification the most popular. We already mentioned
      geometry talks by Samuel Gulden and Doris Schattschneider. Famous
      mathematicians delivered the remaining three lectures. A. S. Besicovitch, known for his negative answer to the Kakeya conjecture, spoke on a related topic in his
      1959 talk, <q>Some extremal problems in geometry</q>. Initially he had selected a
      different subject, as suggested by the title he first submitted, <q>Sharpening
      Lebesque theorems on differentiation</q>, but he must have changed his mind in the
      days leading up to the meeting. It does not seem to be well known that
      Besicovitch directed a Ph.D. dissertation at Penn in 1962. In 1970 Washington’s
      Victor Klee discussed <q>Some unsolved problems from intuitive geometry,</q> and
      one year later Rafael Artzy viewed <q>Analytic geometry stripped of all but
      incidence</q>. Artzy was then at Temple University, but in 1976 he became the
      department head at the University of Haifa in Israel.
    </p>

    <p><foreign>Algebra/Number Theory</foreign></p>
    <p>
      Eight addresses in the category of algebra/number theory were delivered, and
      all six in algebra dealt with mainstream topics. We already mentioned Samuel
      Plotkin’s 1976 talk on applications of group theory to music and Stephen Shatz’s
      1977 talk on algebraic curves. The four other talks on algebra were M. O. Rabin
      (1956), <q>Impossibility of computational algorithms for group-theoretic
      problems</q>; J. C. Moore (1966), <q>Some aspects of homological algebra –
      Background and recent developments</q>; James Brooks (1967), <q>Equivalence of
      matrices and modules over Dedekind domains</q>; and Charles Curtis (1968),
      <q>Characters of finite groups</q>. The two talks on number theory were Peter Scherk
      (1956), <q>Integers,</q> and Hans Rademacher (1961), <q>Gaussian polynomials and
      pentagonal numbers</q>. Rademacher’s talk was the last of four that he gave to the
      section.
    </p>

    <p><foreign>Applications</foreign></p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> noted that many of the lectures on applications from 1942-1955
      were delivered during World War II. In the period 1956-1978, however, there
      was a much wider range of applications, and not one was war-related. The first,
      titled <q>Mathematical models in the biological sciences,</q> was given in 1971 by
      Willard Baxter, who played a key role in developing the excellent program in
      applied mathematics at the University of Delaware. Two years later A. J.
      Goldman, Chief of Operations Research at the National Bureau of Standards
      (now NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology), spoke on
      <q>Some mathematical operations research in government</q>. The 1976 meeting
      featured two talks on applications, Nelson Max, <q>Catastrophe theory and its
      applications,</q> and Jane Cronin, whose lecture carried the intriguing title,
      <q>Mathematical aspects of periodic catatonic schizophrenia</q>. The following year
      Steve Rohde, of General Motors Research Laboratories, drove home several
      points in his lecture, <q>Some mathematical aspects in the design of automotive
      components</q>. In 1977 Rohde received the Newkirk Award from American
      Society of Mechanical Engineers for his contributions to tribology (the study of
      friction, wear, and lubrication). We already mentioned Dorothy Bernstein’s 1978
      lecture, <q>The role of applications in pure mathematics</q>. That same year Chris Rorres presented a lecture titled <q>The application of linear programming to the
      optimal harvesting of a renewable resource</q>.
    </p>
    <p><foreign>Combinatorics/Graph Theory</foreign></p>
    <p>
      A new interest in the section surfaced during this period – combinatorics/
      graph theory. Not surprisingly, Herbert Wilf fanned this interest with his 1967
      lecture <q>Counting finite graphs</q>. Wilf delivered another talk from this field eight
      years later, <q>How to choose k out of n</q>. In 1972 Roger Entringer traveled from
      New Mexico to discuss <q>Open problems in combinatorial analysis and graph
      theory</q>. Earlier we mentioned the two remaining talks in graph theory – John
      Koch (1976), <q>The proof of the four color theorem,</q> and Thomas Saaty (1978),
      <q>Priorities, hierarchies, and behavioral systems</q>.
    </p>

    <p><foreign>Probability/Statistics</foreign></p>
    <p>
      As usual, only a few talks were dedicated to probability or statistics. Three
      were given in this period: Stuart Hunter (1957), <q>Experimental statistics – Some
      of the concepts and mathematical requirements,</q> R. D. Luce (1959),
      <q>Probabilistic models in psychology for the study of choice behavior,</q> and
      Bennett Eisenberg (1975), <q>Uniformly distributed sequences, stationary
      processes and the ergodic theorem</q>.
    </p>
    <p><foreign>Miscellaneous</foreign></p>
    <p>
      Five of the lectures do not fit into any category yet are deserving of mention
      because they celebrated mathematics for its own sake. Three were delivered at
      the 1963 meeting: C. K. Brown, <q>The search for delightful results,</q> Marguerite
      Lehr, <q>A little mathematics of the multiplication table variety,</q> and Pincus
      Schub, <q>Some mathematical crumbs</q>. Lehr’s lecture was the fourth she gave to
      the section, 31 years after her initial talk in 1932. She also spoke in 1944 and
      1954. We already mentioned Mordell’s 1969 talk titled <q>Reminiscences</q>. We
      end with the delightful title of a lecture delivered in 1971 by longtime MAA
      Executive Director Alfred B. Willcox, <q>England was lost on the playing fields of
      Eton: A parable for mathematics</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this discussion shows that most of the activities that took place at
      annual meetings from 1956 to 1978 centered on educational issues, as evidenced
      by both panel discussions and invited lectures. Among the invited lectures, the
      categories of analysis and topology/geometry garnered the greatest number of
      speakers, although an increasing number were concerned with algebra,
      applications, and combinatorics/graph theory. Talks in algebra considered
      mainstream topics for the first time, while the applications were varied and
      unrelated to war projects.

    <title>Profile: Willard Ellis Baxter</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h>Baxter, Willard Ellis</h></idx>
    <p>
      Willard E. Baxter was born on December 14, 1929, in Chester, PA. He
      obtained his bachelors degree from Ursinus College in 1951 and an M.S. from
      the University of Wisconsin the following year. He then enrolled in the graduate
      program at the University of Pennsylvania, leading to a Ph.D. in 1956 for a
      dissertation on ring theory written under the algebraist I. N. Herstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon graduation Baxter taught at Ohio University for two years before
      accepting a position as assistant professor at the University of Delaware in 1958.
      He remained at Delaware until his retirement in 1994. In 1970 he succeeded
      Russell Remage as chair of the department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baxter was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1968 for the first of
      two consecutive terms. He remained as chair of his department even longer, five
      years. During that time Baxter served as the section’s governor from 1971 to
      1974. He has been one of the most active members of the section, being elected
      to the Executive Committee in 1967, being a panel member in 1970, accepting an
      invitation to speak in 1971, serving as secretary-treasurer from 1976 to 1982, and
      reminiscing about the history of the section at the luncheon held during the
      annual fall meeting at Delaware in 1990. (The text of Baxter’s address is
      reproduced in Appendix 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1984 the national MAA instituted an award <q>for service to the MAA at the
      national level or for service to a Section of the Association</q>. Honorees are
      recognized annually at the January meeting of the Association. Will Baxter was
      the first recipient from our section, being awarded the Certificate of Meritorious
      Service in 1986. We quote the MAA citation in its entirety:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p><term>CERTIFICATE OF MERITORIUS SERVICE</term></p>
<p>
      The Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section of the Mathematical
      Association of America is pleased to nominate Professor Willard E. Baxter as the
      section’s first recipient of the MAA certificate of meritorious service. The section
      gratefully recognizes the many contributions Will has made not only to the MAA
      but to the wider mathematical community of researchers, teachers and students,
      both in high school and universities.
</p>
<p>
      A student of I. N. Herstein, Will Baxter received his Ph.D. from the university
      of Pennsylvania in 1956. Known as a fine research algebraist, he has been on the
      mathematics faculty at the University of Delaware for 28 years, and served as
      department chairman 1970-75.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over thirty years, Will has been an active participant in MAA activities.
      He has served the EPADEL section in every possible capacity: as a member of
      the Section Executive Committee 1967-69, as Section Chairman 1969-71, as
      Section Governor 1971-74, and as Section Secretary-Treasurer 1976-82. An
      enthusiastic and popular lecturer, he has given invited addresses at two section
      meetings. Mindful that Delaware is not a suburb of Philadelphia, he was
      instrumental in having the section name (formerly <q>Philadelphia Section</q>)
      changed to its present geographically descriptive form. Throughout his years as
      officer of the section, Will was the person to turn to when a difficult task had to
      be done, and was a primary source of guidance for section activities and policy
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will’s enthusiasm for and encouragement of young mathematical talent is
      evidenced by his long and continuing involvement as regional coordinator of the
      annual American High School Mathematics Examination and as director of the
      Delaware Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. He has also had a fruitful
      association with in-service training of teachers of mathematics, and is currently
      involved in materials development for high schools. His concern for the teaching
      of service calculus courses, coupled with his interest in mathematical modeling
      produced a pioneering book, co-authored with Clifford W. Sloyer which
      combined probability with calculus and was intended for students in the
      biological and managerial sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these activities have contributed to the life and health of the
      mathematical community. For his many years of dedication and service, we are
      pleased to honor Will Baxter with this award.

<section><title>Profile: Anna Marguerite Marie Lehr (1898-1987)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Lehr, Anna Marguerite Marie (1898-1987)</h></idx>
<p>
We have met Marguerite Lehr in every chapter but the first. Who is this
woman who received her Bryn Mawr Ph.D. under Charlotte Angas Scott in 1925
(Chapter 2), who delivered four invited addresses to the Philadelphia Section – in
1932 (Chapter 3), in 1944 (Chapter 5; on aerial photography), in 1954 (Chapter
5; on a TV series), and in 1963 (this chapter) – and who was elected chair of the
section in 1955, the first woman to hold this office since Anna Pell Wheeler in
1943?
</p>
<p>
Marguerite Lehr was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 22, 1898. Her
father was a grocer. Marguerite was the only one of five children to attend
college. While a student at Goucher College, she gave a talk to the mathematics
club titled <q>Geometry of four dimensions</q>. She graduated from Goucher in 1919
with a B.A. degree in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
Lehr planned to remain in Baltimore, at Johns Hopkins, for graduate work.
However, a job offer as a Reader for Charlotte Angas Scott caused her to change
her mind, so she enrolled at Bryn Mawr instead. This position required Lehr to
answer questions in Scott’s classes and to hold office hours for her. (Scott was
completely deaf by then.) In addition to Scott, Lehr studied mathematics at Bryn
Mawr under Anna Pell Wheeler and W. B. Huff. Indeed, Lehr can be seen as
continuing the tradition of mathematical excellence at Bryn Mawr, as the
following dates suggest:
<ul>
<li>Charlotte Angas Scott (1858-1931)</li>
<li>Anna Pell Wheeler (1883-1966)</li>
<li>Marguerite Lehr (1898-1987)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Lehr ended up as Scott’s last Ph.D. student when she received her degree in
mathematics and physics in 1925. Her dissertation, <q>The plane quintic with five
cusps,</q> appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1927. Almost 50
years later Lehr wrote a biography of her beloved mentor for the book Notable
American Women, 1607-1950 (pp. 249-250).
</p>
<p>
Bryn Mawr awarded its Thomas Fellowship to Lehr in 1920, but she did not
use it to travel abroad until 1923. That year she combined it with an AAUW
fellowship to study algebraic geometry with the Italian geometers at the
University of Rome.
</p>
<p>
Lehr returned to Bryn Mawr in 1924 and accepted an instructorship in
mathematics. She remained there for the rest of her professional career. During
this time she took study leaves at Johns Hopkins (1931-1932), the Poincaré
Institute in Paris (1949-1950), and Princeton (1956-1957). She also taught in the
war-training program at Swarthmore College in 1944.
</p>
<p>
One of Lehr’s main interests was the use of television for teaching
mathematics. This was first seen when she conducted a series of television shows
from October 1953 to January 1954. Titled <q>Invitation to mathematics,</q> the
series was shown on Channel 6, WFIL, one of Philadelphia’s three major
network stations, as part of the program called <q>University of the Air</q>. Lehr’s
aim was <q>to show the average viewer the intention of mathematics, the
mathematization drive, as a natural and power aid toward ordering our
experience</q>. She prepared a course syllabus of abstracts and readings that the TV
station circulated for twenty-five cents! The first topic – regular shapes via tiles –
brings to mind a topic favored by Doris Schattschneider, who is profiled below.
</p>
<p>
The 1950s was a time of live TV so all of Lehr’s lectures were delivered
without any re-takes! She summarized her experiences in two articles. Her paper,
<q>An experiment with television,</q> appeared in the January 1955 issue of the
<pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. In addition she wrote an article in the fall 1956 issue of the Goucher
Alumnae Quarterly with the cute title, <q>Of dice and men</q>.
</p>
<p>
Lehr became known as one of the experts in the use of this new medium. In
1957 NBC hired her as a consultant for a TV series on mathematics whose guests
included Emil Artin, H. M. S. Coxeter, Saunders Mac Lane, William Feller, and
Richard Courant. She was also appointed to the MAA’s Committee on
Instructional Films, which produced a series of films to reach teachers and
students who had no access to creative mathematicians. The Committee’s report
was published in the June/July 1958 issue of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>.
</p>
<p>
Lehr was appointed one of the MAA’s visiting lectures for 1958-1959. Other
visiting lecturers that year were Tom Apostol, John Kelley, Lynn Loomis, S. S.
Wilks, and S. Ulam. Impressive company! During the year Lehr accepted
invitations to speak in New England, northern New York, Ohio, Kansas, Iowa,
and Minnesota.
</p>
<p>
Marguerite Lehr retired from Bryn Mawr College in 1967. Upon her
retirement she received a prestigious Lindback Award <q>in recognition of her
brilliance as a teacher, for which generations of students will remember her.</q>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the publication of her dissertation in 1927, Lehr published two
more papers in the American Journal – one in 1931 with Virgil Snyder of Cornell
on involutions of infinite discontinuous Cremona subgroups of S 4 and the other
in 1932 on singularities of curves. After World War II her primary mathematical
interest shifted to probability theory and its applications.

<title>Profile: Doris Jean Schattschneider</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Schattschneider, Doris Jean</h></idx>
<p>
Doris Schattschneider is one of the EPADEL’s most decorated members.
Born in New York City to Robert and Charlotte (Ingalls) Wood, she took her
undergraduate degree in 1961 from the University of Rochester. She then
enrolled in the graduate program at Yale. One year later she married David E.
Schattschneider. The newlyweds moved to Northwestern that year because David
had won a Danforth internship there, so Doris spent the 1962-1963 academic
year as a graduate student there as well. At the end of the year she received an
M.A. degree from Yale. When David next moved to Chicago to embark on his
Ph.D. program, Doris called Ralph Boas to ask if there were any openings. She
recalled, <q>Two days later he phoned me to say I had a job as instructor.</q> So Doris
taught at Northwestern for the 1964-1965 academic year before moving to the
nearby University of Illinois at Chicago campus, where she taught until 1968.
</p>
<p>
With impressive tenacity, Doris continued her own doctoral program at Yale.
Although Ichiro Satake (University of Chicago) mentored her, and gave her the
research problem she solved to complete her dissertation when she ran up against
a stone wall with the original problem, the official Yale advisor for her 1966
degree is T. Tamagawa. The title of her dissertation, <q>Restricted roots of a semi-
simple algebraic group</q>, contains no hint of her future expertise in geometry.
</p>
<p>
Schattschneider accepted a professorship at Moravian College in 1968 and she
has remained at the Bethlehem school ever since, serving two stints as chair of
the department, 1971-1974 and 1985-1991. Her initial involvement with the
Philadelphia Section came at the annual meeting in 1974 when she presented the
film she had produced with the captivating title, <q>Rotating polyhedral forms: M.
C. Escher with a twist</q>. She was elected vice-chair of the section in each of the
next two years (1975-1977) and elected chair the following two years (1977-
1979). She also presented an invited lecture at the 1977 annual meeting titled,
<q>Tiling the plane with pentagons: A perplexing problem</q>. An excellent speaker,
in 1988 she became the first woman to deliver Pi Mu Epsilon’s J. Sutherland
Frame Lecture.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, in 1995 Schattschneider was selected to present the MAA’s
prestigious Hedrick Lectures. Named for the first president of the MAA, these
lectures were established in 1952 to be delivered by a mathematician <q>of known
skill as an expositor of mathematics who will present a series of at most three
lectures accessible to a large fraction of those who teach college mathematics</q>.
Only two other section officers, John Oxtoby (in 1956) and Nathan Fine (1966),
have delivered Hedrick lectures. However, several of our section’s invited
speakers did: Paul R. Halmos (1953), William Feller (1959), R. H. Bing (1961),
Hans Rademacher (1963), George E. Andrews (1980), John Conway (1991), and
Ronald Graham (1994).
</p>
<p>
Schattschneider has also been an active participant in the national MAA. She
was the first woman editor of Mathematics Magazine (1981-1985), served as a
governor from 1981 to 1989, and was elected vice-president from 1994 to 1996.
In addition, she was a councilor for Pi Mu Epsilon from 1990 to 1996. Her
activity has garnered her several awards, including the 1979 Allendoerfer Award
for her paper <q>Tiling the plane with congruent pentagons,</q> which appeared in
Mathematics Magazine the previous year. She was also awarded a Certificate of
Meritorious Service by the MAA in 1991. In the year 2000, Gerald Porter and
she were awarded certificates of appreciation for their role <q>in the installation of
a very special tiling in the front lobby area</q> of the MAA headquarters. Finally,
she won the MAA’s initial Haimo Award for Distinguished College or
University Teaching of Mathematics in 1993. Only two other members of our
section have won this award, Herbert S. Wilf in 1996 and Rhonda Hughes in
1998.
</p>
<p>
Doris Schattschneider has written numerous works that have been popular and
positively reviewed. In 1979, she wrote the book (with L. F. Baker), <pubtitle>The
Perceptive Eye: Art and Mathematics</pubtitle>, which was based on a special exhibit held
at the Allentown Art Museum in the spring of that year. Schattschneider was a
curator of this exhibit! An especially successful book titled M. C. Escher
Kaleidocycles, written with Wallace Walker, appeared in different versions in
1977, 1982, and 1987. From 1986 to 1991 she was the senior associate and
<q>geometer</q> of the Visual Geometry Project, directed by Gene Klotz and funded
by the NSF. This project produced videos and activity books on polyhedra and
symmetry; it now offers the popular software program called The Geometer’s
Sketchpad.
</p>
<p>
Schattschneider’s most famous work might be her 1990 book <pubtitle>Visions of
Symmetry: Notebooks, Periodic Drawings, and Related Work of M. C. Escher</pubtitle>.
With funding from FIPSE, she joined Dennis Ebersole, Alicia Sevilla, and Kay
Somers in developing and disseminating a course that integrates precalculus
review with the first course in calculus; this project produced the 1995 text <pubtitle>A
Companion to Calculus</pubtitle>. Schattschneider returned to the mix of art and
mathematics in 1996 while serving as a <q>talking head</q> to explain Escher’s
tessellations on the CD Rom <pubtitle>Escher Interactive: Exploring the Art of the Infinite</pubtitle>.
More recently she was an editor for the 1997 MAA book <pubtitle>Geometry Turned On</pubtitle>.
In that same year she was interviewed live for a radio program in honor of the
Canadian geometer H. S. M. Coxeter; a cassette from the program is available in
the Reeves Library at Moravian. Her current project is editing a book of 40
articles that resulted from the 1998 Escher Centennial Congress in Rome.

<title> Profile: Albert Wilansky</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Wilansky, Albert</h></idx>
<p>
Albert Wilansky has been one of the most active members of the
Philadelphia/EPADEL Section. Born in 1921 in St. Johns, Newfoundland,
Wilansky remained in Canada for his undergraduate education, his first degree
being an M.A. from Dalhousie University in 1944. He then enrolled in the
graduate program at Brown University and received his Ph.D. under C. R. Adams
three years later for a dissertation titled, <q>Application of Banach linear
functionals to summability</q>.

Wilansky is mostly known as <q>Tommy</q>. The origin of this name is obscure;
his family thinks it is due to the name of the doctor who delivered him. In 1947
Tommy Wilansky married Ruth Leah Paton, whom he had met at Dalhousie
University. They had two daughters, Eleanor and Laura. His daughter Eleanor
Myers is a professor at the Temple University School of Law who received a
Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2001.

<p>
Wilansky came to Lehigh in 1948 and has remained there ever since, retiring
officially in 1992. He was the university’s Distinguished Professor of
Mathematics for the final 14 years of his tenure. During his 44 years at Lehigh he
was a Fulbright visiting professor several times, at universities in Reading (1972-
1973), London (1973), Tel Aviv (1981), and Berne (1981). Outside of academia
he was a consultant for the Frankford Arsenal for the year 1957-1958.
</p>
<p>
Wilansky published numerous papers in analysis (especially summability),
linear topological spaces, Banach algebras, and functional analysis. He is also the
author of several books in these fields. His first, Functional Analysis, appeared in
1964. Three years later a book based on lecture notes from a graduate course he
offered, Topics in Functional Analysis, was published by one of his doctoral
students, William D. Laverell. Wilansky’s Topology for Analysis was first
published in 1970; the second edition appeared in 1983. His Modern Methods in
Topological Vector Spaces appeared in 1978. A manuscript stored in the library
at Lehigh indicates that the intended title of this work was going to be
Topological Vector Spaces. As the author stated, <q>It will continue to say
‘Modern’ forever.</q> Wilansky’s last book appeared in 1984, Summability Through
Functional Analysis.

<p>
In addition to this prodigious output, Albert Wilansky directed 20 doctoral
dissertations between 1958 and 1980, an average of almost one a year. Two of
his students, James Crawford (Lafayette) and Peter Jessup (Ursinus), have also
been active members of this section, a wonderful gift handed down from their
mentor.
</p>
<p>
Wilansky has been active in sectional affairs in various ways. For one, he
served as chair of the section for 1956-1957. For another, he holds the record for
delivering the most invited lectures to the section, five, over a span of 34 years
(1950, 1956, 1963, 1970, and 1983). In 1969 the MAA presented him its
prestigious Ford Award for a paper he published in Mathematics Magazine.
Today these awards recognize authors of articles of expository excellence
published in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, but up to <m>1976</m> articles could have been published in
<pubtitle>Mathematics Magazine</pubtitle> as well. Since then, the Allendoerfer Awards – named
after another EPADEL leader – recognize outstanding papers written in the latter
journal.

<p>
In 1969, after the death of his first wife, Wilansky married Rose Kutler, and
together they raised her three children – Kathy, Leslie and Carole. All three live
close to Bethlehem, where he currently resides. Since Wilansky’s retirement in
1992, he has been deeply involved in the lives of his eight grandchildren, and has
maintained an active worldwide correspondence with many children of his five
brothers and sisters.
