<title>Preface</title>
<p>
The <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> has played a large role
in my professional life since my undergraduate days at Pennsylvania
Military College (shortened to PMC, but now called Widener
University). Three serendipitous events formed the basis for my future
involvement in the Association during my three years there.
</p>
<p>
The first occurred while I was in the school’s library doing research
for a term paper in one of two required composition courses. Taking a
break from Occam’s Razor, I perused the stacks in the school’s small
library, which then consisted of only two rooms. Although a general
science major, I maintained a strong interest in mathematics, so my
eyes were drawn to the only magazine on mathematics in the stacks, the
<em>American Mathematical Monthly</em>. I soon learned to call it a
<q>journal</q> instead of a <q>magazine</q>. But I found the articles
inscrutable. A year later, having scanned every issue of the journal
upon its arrival, I asked Professor Claude Helms, then head of the
department, <q>What’s topology?</q> <q>Some newfangled theory,</q> he
replied offhandedly.
</p>
<p>
But Helms encouraged me to write Harry Gehman, whose name was listed
on the cover of the <em>Monthly</em>. That led to the second event
that would define my career, because the longtime 
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
secretary-treasurer responded with a detailed, personal letter
explaining the path I should follow to study topology. He also invited
me to apply for membership in the <url
href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. So began my first, tentative
steps toward becoming a mathematician, though an algebraist and not a
topologist. Upon transferring to Temple University, I elected a course
with Dr. Marie Wurster, who taught me the critical ability to write
proofs.
</p>
<p>
The third decisive event took place when the Temple chair, Dr. Walter
Lawton, encouraged me to attend a sectional meeting of the 
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. So, on a nasty, wind-swept
November morning, I trudged to Haverford College to spend an entire
Saturday immersed in words and concepts that belonged on a different
planet. Yet the spirit of the speakers, especially Pincus Schub of
Penn – a little, old man with big, young ideas – was infectious.
</p>
<p>
These three events - discovering the <em>Monthly</em>, joining the
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and attending its sectional
meetings - conspired to draw me ineluctably to the present work. They
also highlighted the central role that individuals play in our
professional development. It is my grandest hope that this book
enables other sectional members to understand and to appreciate our
rich heritage. I also hope that other mathematicians will learn about
the important role this local microcosm has played in the more global
American mathematical community.
