    <p>
      This name is usually abbreviated EPADEL, although there is wide
      disagreement whether to pronounce the first syllable as eep or epp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1926 two Lehigh University mathematicians joined forces with
      a colleague from the University of Pennsylvania to organize the
      first formal program of mathematical lectures in the
      section. Ultimately their activity generated the very first 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section in the eastern
      United States. Beginning with an application for a charter from
      the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, the section was
      initially called the Philadelphia Section in spite of the fact
      that its membership ranged throughout eastern and central
      Pennsylvania, the whole state of Delaware, and southern New
      Jersey. Even today, 75 years after the founding, the
      Philadelphia area remains the hub of activity for a geographical
      region stretching from Wilkes Barre and Mansfield in the north
      to the tip of Delaware in the south, and from the Shippensburg-
      Gettysburg-Dickinson triangle in the west to the Lehigh Valley
      in the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      The section has a glorious history. Before turning to that
      history we pause to examine briefly the background of its
      founding. First we outline the history of the country’s two
      major organizations – the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
      and the AMS (American Mathematical Society). Then we chronicle
      their official journals, including a biographical sketch of one
      leading figure, Benjamin F. Finkel, who has strong ties to the
      area. The chapter ends with a discussion of the emergence of
      official sections within both the AMS and the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers eager to read about the section’s history are encouraged
      to jump to <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter </xref> for an
      account of the founding, or to <xref ref="EPADEL">
      Chapter</xref> and <xref ref="SpringMeetings"> Chapter</xref>
      for an analysis of activities over the past <m>2</m>
      years. Overall, the chapters are generally independent of one
      another, though a common thread runs throughout the entire work.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <section>
    <title>The AMS</title>
    <p>
      Neither the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS </url> nor the
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> was created in a
      vacuum. The history of professional organizations in the country
      began with associations devoted to more general scientific
      matters, such as the American Philosophical Society. The APS was
      founded in Philadelphia in <m>1743</m> as the country’s first
      professional society devoted to science. By the end of the 19 th
      century many of these general organizations evolved into
      societies dedicated to a particular science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first movement to form an organization of scientists
      interested primarily in mathematics took place in New York City
      in <m>1817</m> when a transplanted Englishman, William Marrat,
      convened a gathering of eight mathematicians.  Although this
      group endured for eight years, it seems to have expired when
      Marrat returned to England in <m>1825</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No attempt at founding an organization devoted to mathematics
      would occur for another 63 years. In <m>1888</m> Thomas Scott
      Fiske, inspired by meetings of the London Mathematical Society,
      returned to New York City from a yearlong visit to Cambridge,
      England, <q>filled with the thought that there should be a
      stronger feeling of comradeship among those interested in
      mathematics. I proposed to my classmates and friendly rivals,
      Jacoby and Stabler, that we should try to organize a local
      mathematical Society.</q> Together the three graduate students
      printed and distributed the notice of an organizational meeting
      of the New York Mathematical Society (NYMS). It is relevant to
      the history of EPADEL that the meeting was held on Thanksgiving
      Day (in particular, November <m>24</m>, <m>1888</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Interest in the NYMS proceeded slowly at first but by the early
      1890s its membership began to increase more rapidly, growing
      from only <m>6</m> in <m>1888</m> to <m>251</m> in
      <m>1894</m>. By <m>1894</m> there was sufficient demand to
      expand the Society’s meetings to locales beyond New York
      City. The name was changed to reflect this expansion to a
      national organization, called the American Mathematical Society.
      As a corollary, the Society’s officicial journal was renamed the
      <em>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</em>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title><em>The Monthly</em></title>
    <p>
      There were several short-lived attempts to establish mathematical journals
      throughout the <m>19</m>th century, including the <pubtitle>Mathematical Correspondent</pubtitle> and three
      different periodicals called <pubtitle>The Analyst</pubtitle>. The first to find a permanent niche on
      American soil was the <pubtitle>American Journal of Mathematics</pubtitle>, founded at Johns
      Hopkins University in 1878 by J. J. Sylvester and William Story. Six years later a
      second such journal was initiated by Ormond Stone at the University of Virginia,
      the <em>Annals of Mathematics</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular relevance was the launching in 1858 by John Runkle
      of a journal he called the <pubtitle>Mathematical
      Monthly</pubtitle>. Although it ceased publication with the onset of
      the Civil War in 1861, it was reestablished in 1894 as the
      <pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle>. Initially the
      <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>’s masthead read, <q>founded in 1894 by Benjamin
      F. Finkel, [and] published by him until 1913. From 1913 to 1916
      it was owned and published by representatives of fourteen
      Universities and Colleges in the Middle West.</q> Because the
      founding of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> is
      intimately intertwined with the history of its official journal,
      we must relate a few facts about the journal’s founder,
      including two close ties to the Philadelphia area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Benjamin Franklin Finkel (1865-1947)</alert> earned
            a B. S. degree from Ohio Northern in 1888 and then taught
            high school mathematics. He managed to stay professionally
            active by contributing to the problem departments in
            several publications, including the Saturday Evening
            Post. In 1895 Finkel was appointed professor of
            mathematics and physics at Drury College in Missouri,
            where in 1894 he began to publish the <pubtitle>American
            Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle> in order to improve instruction
            in high school mathematics. His first action in publishing
            the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> was to secure the editorial
            assistance of a high school teacher, <alert>John
            Colaw</alert>, who had received a bachelors degree
            (<m>1882</m>) and a masters degree (<m>1892</m>) from
            Dickinson College.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colaw’s background at Dickinson provides one link between
            the Philadelphia area and the founding of the <url
            href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.  Another involves
            Finkel himself. He left his position at Drury College for
            two periods of study, the second at the University of
            Pennsylvania, where he earned an A. M. degree in
            <m>1904</m> and a Ph.D. in <m>1906</m>. By the time Finkel
            returned to Drury College in the fall of <m>1906</m>, it
            had become apparent that college and university
            instructors demonstrated much more interest in the journal
            than its intended audience of high school teachers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The NYMS created the <em>Bulletin</em> in <m>1891</m>. The <url
      href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> created the Transactions nine
      years later. That is the customary order in which these entities are
      related, with societies establishing journals. Not so with the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, however.  <pubtitle>The Monthly</pubtitle>
      actually spawned the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, not
      the other way around, and so this section of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> can lay claim to playing a
      decisive role in founding the national organization it would become a
      part of in <m>1926</m>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title> The <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url></title>
    <p>
      We mentioned above that the masthead of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>
      carried the message, <q>From <m>1913</m> to <m>1916</m> it was
      owned and published by representatives of fourteen Universities
      and Colleges in the Middle West.</q> This note suggests the
      tenuous nature of funding at this time. Its managing editor,
      Herbert Slaught, realized that colleges offered uncertain
      support, so he proposed that the <url
      href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> sponsor the
      <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. The <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>
      formed a Committee to consider this issue, but it voted <m>3</m>
      to <m>2</m> against such an undertaking. The Council of the <url
      href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> accepted the Committee’s
      report, resolving:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is deemed unwise for the American Mathematical Society to
        enter into the activities of the special field now covered by
        the <pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle>; but the Council
        desires to express its realization of the importance of the
        work in this field and its value to mathematical science, and
        to say that <alert>should an organization be formed</alert> to deal
        specifically with this work the Society would entertain toward
        such an organization only feelings of hearty good will and
        encouragement. [Our emphasis.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Herbert Slaught immediately launched a movement to follow up on
      the Council’s suggestion to form an association. He arranged an
      organizational meeting at the joint gathering of the 
      <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> and the AAAS (American
      Association for the Advancement of Science) held December 30-31,
      1915, at the Ohio State University. Earle Hedrick presided over
      the 104 people in attendance. All organizational matters were
      settled within three hours on the very first day of the meeting
      except for the official name of the organization, which was
      adopted the next day. Consequently the Mathematical Association
      of America was born on New Year’s Eve, <m>1915</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time almost all national meetings took place near
      holidays, especially Thanksgiving and New Year’s. Today few
      meetings of mathematical organizations are held during either
      the Thanksgiving weekend or the week between Christmas and New
      Year’s Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only then that a committee was established to negotiate
      with the owners of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> to secure the
      publication as the official journal of the Association.
      However, it was the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> that had spawned the
      Association to begin with!
    </p>
  </section>
  <section><title>Sections</title>
  <p>
    Although the New York Mathematical Society had expanded to the
    American Mathematical Society in <m>1894</m>, few Midwesterners were able
    to make the long journey to the Society’s meetings, which
    continued to be held in the East. Todress this issue, a two-day
    conference was convened in Chicago on December 31, 1896, with the
    aim of founding a local section of the American Mathematical
    Society. When the resulting resolutions were later transmitted to
    the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, the Council of the
    Society authorized the formation of sectional meetings by adding a
    new clause to its by-laws. The first official meeting of the
    Chicago Section of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>
    was held on April <m>24</m>, <m>1897</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other parts of the country soon caught the sectional fever. The
    San Francisco Section was formed in <m>1902</m> and the Southwestern
    Section in <m>1906</m>. However, as a sign of persisting regional biases,
    meetings of the Chicago Section were not designated as official
    <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meetings until 1913, and
    meetings of other Sections not until <m>1929</m>. Such a designation was
    important professionally because publication in the Transactions
    of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, for instance,
    was only possible for papers presented at official Society
    meetings.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> was
    established from the NYMS in <m>1894</m>, with its first three
    sections formed in <m>1897</m>, <m>1902</m>, and <m>1906</m>. The
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> was founded in
    <m>1915</m>. How long did it take this organization to form
    sections?
  </p>
  <p>
    It took just a few minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> constitution was
    drawn up on the first day of its organizational meeting in
    Columbus, Ohio, on December <m>30</m>, <m>1915</m>. The authors
    specifically provided for the formation of sections, so by the
    time the constitution was formally adopted the next day a group
    from Kansas had already drafted a petition to become the first
    official section of the newly formed Association.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet that honor would go to a group from another state. A group of
    college mathematics teachers in Ohio also met on the first day of
    the organizational meeting to vote on whether to form the Ohio
    Section of the newly formed 
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.  Organizationally savvy,
    they created a special committee at once to prepare their own
    constitution. Therefore the Ohio group, like their counterparts in
    Kansas, was poised for action when the national <url
    href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> constitution was approved.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within one hour of the adoption of the 
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
    constitution on December <m>31</m>, three state organizations
    presented petitions to become formal sections, with Missouri
    joining Kansas and Ohio. It is no wonder that Missouri would
    position itself favorably. Since <m>1894</m>, college mathematics
    teachers in the appropriately nicknamed <q>Show Me</q> state
    provided sufficient support for the publication of the
    <pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle> under Benjamin
    F. Finkel. Besides, Earle R.  Hedrick, then at the University of
    Missouri, was one of the founders of the national <url
    href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and served as its first
    president.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the fact that Ohio State was the site of the 
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> organizational meeting
    afforded a distinct advantage in the contest to become the first
    official <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section. So,
    not surprisingly, Ohio beat Missouri by a few minutes in the
    heated race to secure the first section charter. Kansas placed
    third.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faced with the overwhelming and immediate response of applications
    from three state associations, the Council of the 
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> [now called the Board of
    Governors] created a Committee on Sections right there at its own
    organizational meeting to formulate terms under which sections
    could be approved. The application from Ohio was the first to be
    granted, on March <m>1</m>, <m>1916</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ohio Section was not the first to hold an official sectional
    meeting, however. That honor reverted to the Kansas Section, which
    met on March <m>18</m> at the University of Kansas. The Ohio
    Section held its first meeting a month later for two days, and has
    held annual meetings every spring since then except for the year
    <m>1945</m>. Meanwhile the Missouri Section waited until November
    to hold its first meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Four more <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> sections were
    formed during the year <m>1916</m>. Three of these represented midwestern
    states: Iowa, Indiana, and Minnesota. The other section
    established that year had a different geographical boundary: the
    Maryland-Virginia-District of Columbia Section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next <m>10</m> years state sections were formed in
    Kentucky, Illinois, Texas, Michigan, and Nebraska. Three other
    sections were formed from unions of states - the Rocky Mountain
    Section (Colorado and Wyoming), the Southeastern Section (Alabama,
    Florida, Georgia, the two Carolinas, and Tennessee) and the
    Louisiana-Mississippi Section. One new section was a subset of a
    state - the Southern California Section. The latter was formed at
    the urging of Earle Hedrick, who had moved from the University of
    Missouri to the University of California, Southern Branch (now
    UCLA). Hedrick acted as temporary chairman of the section until a
    formal election of officers could be held.
  </p>
  <p>
    Altogether, then, <m>16</m> sections were formed up to
    <m>1925</m>. Our section would be next.
