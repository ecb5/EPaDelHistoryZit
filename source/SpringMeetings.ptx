  <title>Spring Meetings, <m>1975-2000</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The need to hold a second annual meeting was felt by the late 1950s. A
      letter from I. Edward Block (who had been chair 1957-1958) to the newly
      elected chair Marguerite Lehr in December 1958 noted, <q>There seems to
      be a certain state of indifference which permeates the Section, but perhaps
      through continued effort the situation will change.</q> It did, resulting in a report by
      the Executive Committee in 1959 listing 10 possible activities. The first was to
      organize complete programs around a particular topic, and the second was to
      hold two meetings each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would take another 15 years before these suggestions would become a
      reality, and even then they would be somewhat controversial. Yet due to the
      success of two special sessions held in 1975, the section sponsored its first spring
      meeting in 1976. The success of these meetings has resulted in a tradition of
      annual spring meetings that continues today. The two annual meetings often
      exhibit markedly different characters, however, as the 1959 report suggested.
      Whereas fall meetings were designed to appeal to a wide variety of interests
      within mathematics and mathematics education, each spring meeting is generally
      devoted to one theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter is divided into four parts. The first deals with the <q>pre-history</q> of
      spring meetings, as evidenced by the two special sessions in 1975. The second
      examines the dates, sites and themes of all spring meetings held from 1976
      through 2000. The third analyzes the sites of annual meetings at combined fall
      and spring meetings. The final part presents a chronological account of the spring
      meetings from 1976 to 2000, singling out some of the individuals who played
      integral parts. Gerald Porter is profiled at the end of the chapter to honor his
      contributions to the section and the national MAA over a period exceeding 30
      years.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <section><title>Pre-History</title>
  <p>
    The impetus for holding special sessions devoted to a particular theme was a
    questionnaire designed by Eugene Klotz in 1973-1974 and sent to all
    departments in the section. As noted in <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref>, Klotz summarized the
    responses by listing three activities that would appeal to a wide segment of the
    membership. Two of them were holding special meetings and accentuating
    special topics at regular meetings. Joerg Mayer organized the first special session
    in April 1975 at his home institution, Lebanon Valley College. Mayer was then
    in the final leg of his second year as chair of the section. Another special session
    was held that October. For the next two years the two aspects of the Klotz report
    came together as special meetings devoted to a single topic. We examine these
    four sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The special session on computers held at Lebanon Valley on April 12, 1975,
    consisted of three one-hour talks in the morning followed by a bevy of
    workshops in the afternoon. After the opening remarks by the organizer, Joerg
    Mayer, the first invited address was delivered by Wallace J. Growney, who had
    moved to Susquehanna University from the University of Oklahoma a few years
    earlier. His talk, entitled <q>Computer underwear</q>, was described as <q>an
    elementary but fast-paced talk on the hardware and software beneath the surface
    of computing.</q> Next came another EPADEL member, John A. Beidler
    (University of Scranton), with the clever title, <q>The computer, as seen by the
    computer scientist and by the mathematician</q>. The final talk at the morning
    session was <q>Some views on computer science in small colleges</q> by R. Austing
    of the University of Maryland.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="Table24">Table</xref> lists the six workshops that were offered on the afternoon program of
    the special session. The people who offered the workshops were called
    moderators.

  <p>
    About 75 people attended this special session. Its success prompted Wallace
    Growney to organize another special session in the fall, this one devoted to <q>The
    new applied mathematics</q>. The meeting on October 4 was impressive, prompting
    section secretary-treasurer Phillip Bedient to send a congratulatory note to
    Growney. It read, <q>By every measure that I can devise the recent Special Session
    on Applied Mathematics held at Rosemont College was a success. ... Since the
    Session was largely your doing from start to finish, the section owes you a strong
    expression of gratitude for a job well done.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Bedient’s report to the MAA listed the attendance at 158. The section’s
    archives do not contain a meeting program so we are unable to provide details.
    However, the archives include Growney’s outline beforehand, from which we
    conclude that the program consisted of four one-hour sessions. The morning
    program included <q>Mathematics in the social sciences</q> (moderated by Eugene
    Klotz) and <q>Mathematics in biology and medicine</q> (moderated by Growney).
    The afternoon program was envisioned to consist of <q>Statistics, computer
    science, operations research, and other applied areas in the departmental
    curriculum</q> and <q>Careers for mathematics majors</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A letter from Phillip Bedient to Eugene Klotz in December 1975 uses the term
    <q>spring meeting</q> for the first time. As we record below, these meetings have
    been conducted every year since the spring of 1976.

  <p>
    <xref ref="Table25">Table</xref> indicates that, with the exception of 1994, spring meetings are held
    during the last part of March or the first two weeks in April. The reason for the
    earlier meeting date in 1994 was because of the joint session with PSMATYC,
    the Pennsylvania State Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 25 annual spring meetings have been held at 18 different institutions. This
    spread reflects the continuing broadening of sectional activity. Curiously the
    section has met neither at Drexel nor Delaware, although Drexel hosted seven
    fall meetings, the second-most altogether, and Delaware hosted five.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ursinus College hosted three spring meetings, the most of any institution in
    the section. The fall meetings held there in 1938 and 1961 occurred a long time
    before spring meetings were inaugurated. Four institutions hosted two spring
    meetings – Messiah, Millersville, Penn, and Villanova. Millersville and
    Villanova were also the sites for two fall meetings during this period, and Penn
    one, but the section never met at Messiah in the fall.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining 13 institutions, where spring meetings have been held once,
    also reflect wide differences regarding fall meetings. For instance, Lehigh and
    Swarthmore are tied for third place in fall meetings with six each. Similarly, both
    Penn State - Ogontz and West Chester were the sites of three fall meetings. Two
    of these institutions hosted one fall meeting – Cedar Crest and Moravian. The
    spring meeting that the remaining seven colleges hosted was the only time the
    section met there – Albright, Bloomsburg, Harrisburg Area Community College,
    King’s College, Kutztown, LaSalle, and Shippensburg.

  Before considering the themes of the spring meetings, we pause to examine
  the sites of the combined 103 meetings, including the 75 annual fall meetings, the
  25 annual spring meetings, the special meetings held in April and October 1975,
  and the special meeting in October 1990. <xref ref="Table26">Table</xref> lists the 34 different institutions
  that have hosted at least one of the section’s 101 meetings from the
  organizational meeting in 1926 through the fall meeting in the year 2000.
</p>
<p>
  The final column in <xref ref="Table26">Table</xref> classifies each institution into one of five
  categories: D (doctoral university), S (belongs to the State System of Higher
  Education), F (other four-year school that does not offer doctoral programs), B
  (branch campus), and CC (Community College). <xref ref="Table27">Table</xref> summarizes the hosting
  institutions for the 103 meetings according to this classification. The second
  column gives the number of different institutions in each category. The final
  column indicates that the section’s meetings were held primarily at four-year
  schools or doctoral universities (82.5% altogether), split almost evenly. The
  remaining 18 meetings were almost evenly split between universities in the State
  System (10) and a combined category of branch campuses/community colleges
  (8).

<section><title>Chronological Survey</title>
<p>
  The first public notice of the Executive Committee’s express interest in
  sponsoring a second meeting each year occurred in the section’s February 1976
  newsletter. An item titled <q>Special spring meeting</q> announced, <q>Plans are
  brewing for a special session on the use of mathematical models in undergraduate
  teaching Saturday, April 10, at Gettysburg College. Carl Leinbach (Gettysburg)
  is chairman of the planning committee. Other members are Jerry Porter (Penn)
  and Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore.) Professor Leinbach is willing to organize some
  special entertainment for families of members. If enough interest is shown, he
  will plan a bus tour of the battlefield conducted by a member of the Gettysburg
  College History Department.</q> Although those plans did not materialize exactly,
  the idea of holding a spring meeting in addition to the annual fall meeting got off
  to a good start.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting began with welcoming remarks by Leonard Holder, the dean of
  the college and former chair of the mathematics department. Next came a panel
  discussion on the question, <q>What do we mean by mathematical modeling?</q>
  Moderated by Jerry King (Lehigh), the panelists were Fred Roberts (Rutgers) and
  Gerald Thompson (Carnegie-Mellon). The two panelists delivered invited
  lectures after that. Before lunch Thompson spoke on <q>Combinatorial decision –
  Problem applications and solutions.</q> After the meal Roberts described <q>Interval
  graphs, traffic lights, and ecological phase space</q>. Samuel Merrill (Wilkes)
  followed that with a third invited lecture, <q>Citizen voting power under the
  Electoral College system.</q> The day ended with another panel discussion, this one
  devoted to <q>Experiences in the teaching of courses on mathematical modeling.</q>
  Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore) was the moderator, while Gene D. Chase (Messiah)
  and Randall King (Gettysburg) were the panelists.
</p>
<p>
  The format of spring meetings began to evolve the next year when the section
  met at Kutztown. This time the gathering was called a Spring Symposium; the
  theme was <q>Structured Programming</q>. Although the March 1977 newsletter did
  not announce the program, it did list three sessions to be covered by the program
  that would run <q>from 8:00 or 8:30 to 3:00 or 3:30</q>:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An overview of structured programming,
  </li>
  <li>
    Problem solving and structured FORTRAN, and
  </li>
  <li> 
    An example using structured FORTRAN to introduce some basic data
    structure concepts.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  There were four organizers: John Beidler, Ranan R. Bannerji, Wallace Growney,
  and John Koch. Dalton Hunkins was in charge of local arrangements. The
  newsletter also carried an editorial whose title asked, <q>Why should
  mathematicians be interested in structured programming?</q> The question was
  answered by listing three benefits derived from teaching proper programming:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Less emphasis on learning all the idiosyncrasies of a particular language;
  </li>
  <li>
    More emphasis on the use of the three simple control constructs (sequence,
    conditional, and looping);
  </li>
  <li>More emphasis on analysis and design techniques that help to verify the
  correctness of algorithms before programs are written.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Beginning with the 1978 meeting at Ursinus, and continuing ever since, the
  new annual gathering was called the Spring Meeting. Its format resembled a
  typical fall meeting – it began with welcoming remarks and continued with three
  speakers. However, the speakers delivered their lectures before lunch, which was
  served at the unusually late time of 1:30. The final speaker, whose talk was
  scheduled an hour later, was <q>to be announced – speaker from the area of
  Computer Science.</q> The program chairman for the meeting was Leslie K. Arnold
  of Daniel H. Wagner Associates. Although no general theme for the meeting was
  stated officially, one can deduce from the topics of the lectures that the theme
  was applied, or even industrial, mathematics. The three announced speakers, with
  affiliation and title are:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sinclair Scala (General Electric Corp.), <q>Mathematics of heat protection
    systems for planetary entry probes,</q>
  </li>
  <li>
    Arnold Dicke (Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and Temple
    University), <q>Calculation of mortality fluctuation surplus for a life
    insurance company,</q>
  </li>
  <li>
    Joseph Bolmarcich (Quantics, Inc.), <q>Polya contagion with fatalities.</q>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
  The meeting at Penn’s David Rittenhouse Labs the next spring, under
  program chair Gerald J. Porter, was the first one sponsored under the section’s
  new EPADEL name. The announced theme was computer graphics, with one-
  hour morning sessions on graphics hardware and graphics software. Next came
  lunch in the Egyptian Gallery of the University Museum. The two-hour afternoon
  session was devoted to applications of computer graphics in undergraduate
  mathematics education.
</p>
<p>
  The 1980 meeting at Cedar Crest College in Allentown was devoted to
  combinatorics. Two speakers from the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill,
  NJ, addressed this theme in the morning session, Neil Sloane and Jessie
  MacWilliams. The titles of their presentations were <q>Hadamard, Hotelling, and
  Harwitt: A new application of some old mathematics,</q> and <q>A survey of coding
  theory,</q> respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Although the 1981 meeting was ostensibly devoted to computational
  geometry, the lectures reveal a much broader theme. Initially Philip J. Davis was
  scheduled to open the meeting with a talk on computer graphics but due to
  unforeseen circumstances he was replaced by Sandra Fillebrown, who spoke
  about cryptography. Next, Drexel’s William J. Gordon spoke about <q>Computer
  graphics as an aid to problem solving in science and engineering</q>. His colleague,
  Oleh J. Tretiak, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, followed lunch
  with a talk on tomography, a field whose role in CAT scans was only beginning
  to surface at the time. In the final presentation, cleverly titled, <q>Is <m>\mu</m>-math the <m>\nu</m>-
  math?</q> Penn’s Albert Nijenhuis demonstrated <q>a symbolic manipulative program
  capable of performing symbolic differentiation, integration, and other feats on a
  digital computer.</q>
</p>
<p>
  The program at the 1982 meeting reflected the advantage of the flexible
  format over the traditional fare at fall meetings. The theme was curricular
  interfaces, a term that was defined in the first talk of the day, when Anthony
  Ralston (SUNY-Buffalo) proposed replacing calculus as the first course in the
  standard curriculum for mathematics majors by a course in discrete mathematics.
  Next, James P. Crawford (Lafayette) provided a 15-minute rebuttal by raising
  some concerns about such a radical change. Following that came a 30-minute
  <q>Audience discussion</q> moderated by Carl Leinbach (Gettysburg). The final part
  of the morning session featured a lecture by Eugene M. Luks (Bucknell) titled,
  <q>Recent advances in graph isomorphic testing: An application of group theory in
  computer science</q>. Like the morning session, the afternoon did not adhere to the
  usual format of two one-hour talks. Instead, there was a <q>Microcomputer
  medley</q> of five 30-minute presentations on <q>the use of microcomputers and
  intelligent terminals in the teaching of undergraduate mathematics.</q> <xref ref="Table28">Table</xref> lists
  the five speakers, their affiliations, and the titles of their presentations. Some
  presentations were conducted concurrently so the audience could view the
  demonstrations up close and gain hands-on experience with the materials; some
  were also repeated.

<p>
  The morning and afternoon formats did not present the only variations from the
  usual program. Instead of the book display, the Gettysburg duo of David Flesner
  and Carl Leinbach conducted an information exchange concerning computer
  science and mathematics programs.
</p>
<p>
  The next two meetings were conducted in a manner similar to the standard
  format at fall meetings. The theme of the 1983 meeting, <q>Mathematics and
  artificial intelligence</q>, was addressed in two lectures in the morning and two in
  the afternoon. Only three of the talks were announced, however – Aravind Joshi
  (Penn), <q>Grammatical representations in natural language processing: Some
  mathematical results,</q> Jack Minker (Maryland), <q>Logic and its uses in artificial
  intelligence and databases,</q> and Casimir Kulikowski (Rutgers), <q>Expert
  systems</q>.
</p>
<p>
  The theme for the 1984 meeting was <q>Mathematics and communication
  theory</q>. The morning session began after a welcome by the host institution’s
  Dean of the Graduate School, Jerry King. The two invited lectures were Chester
  Salwach (Lafayette), <q>Codes that detect and correct errors,</q> and Andrew
  Odlyzko (Bell Telephone Laboratories), <q>Public key cryptography.</q> A
  demonstration of a Hewlett-Packard processing system occurred between these
  two lectures. The afternoon session featured two lectures, Walter Hiver (Hewlett-
  Packard Corp.), <q>Computer system performance evaluation,</q> and Jack Wolf
  (UMass), <q>Mu Hiaccess communications.</q>
</p>
<p>
  The 1985 meeting took advantage of the flexible format in several ways. For
  one, a social hour was held at the historic Hotel Magee in Bloomsburg on Friday
  night. For another, Garrett Birkhoff reminisced publicly about his life in
  mathematics over lunch on Saturday. But the largest deviation was the four-hour
  workshop on <q>Discrete algorithmic mathematics</q> taught by Swarthmore’s Steven
  Maurer. The four hours were divided evenly into morning and afternoon
  sessions.
</p>
<p>
  The format of the 1986 meeting was also different. The first lecturer, M.
  Zuhair Nashed (Delaware), reflected the day’s theme on numerical linear algebra
  in his talk, <q>Computational methods for linear least squares problems</q>. However,
  the rest of the morning session and the entire afternoon session consisted of
  workshops run by three EPADEL presidents. Drexel’s Howard Anton presented
  a 21⁄2-hour workshop on the linear-algebra software package he developed,
  LINEAR-KIT. Two other one-hour workshops ran concurrently – David Hill
  (Temple), <q>An introduction to PC-MATLAB</q>, and Bernard Kolman (Drexel),
  <q>Matrix algebra for the Macintosh</q>.
</p>
<p>
  The main part of the program for the 1987 meeting consisted of three lectures
  and a panel discussion on the theme of actuarial mathematics, with all
  participants hailing from the EPADEL area. The first speaker was Roy G. Shrum,
  an actuary and a vice-president of the Pennsylvania National Casualty Insurance
  Company, who had passed two actuarial examinations while still an
  undergraduate student at Penn State. Shrum had, in fact, passed all ten exams
  before delivering his presentation, <q>A day in the life of an actuary</q>. The next two
  speakers represented emerging academic programs at local universities. Bonnie
  Averbach, the director of the program in Actuarial Science at Temple, spoke
  about <q>Life contingencies</q>. She was followed by Neil Vance, from Penn’s
  Department of Insurance, a specialist on the use of Fourier analysis in insurance
  problems, whose lecture was titled <q>Approximating total claims of a life
  insurance company</q>. The panel discussion aimed to answer the question, <q>How
  do you prepare to become an actuary?</q> Moderated by Brian Hearsey, the director
  of Lebanon Valley’s acclaimed actuarial program, the panel consisted of recent
  graduates from liberal arts colleges who had pursued careers in actuarial science.
  While the format of the program at the spring 1987 meeting might have been
  fairly standard, the day did not end that way. The last item on the agenda treated
  attendees to a reception at Moravian’s Payne Gallery where they could view an
  exhibit titled <q>A mathematician views M. C. Escher,</q> hosted by our section’s
  Escher specialist, Doris Schattschneider.
</p>
<p>
  The program for the 1988 meeting consisted of four lectures on the theme of
  the day, operations research. Shippensburg’s Fred Nordal, the recipient of a
  Virginia Tech Ph.D. in operations research, began the day with a talk titled,
  <q>Origin, history and some applications of operations research</q>. He was followed
  by George Freestone, the manager of operations research for chemical systems
  development and services at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. His talk on
  <q>Logistics planning for chemicals at Air Products</q> dealt with the application of
  linear programming to customer sourcing and product mix problems in the
  chemicals business. Next, Jeffrey Lagarias of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories provided
  EPADEL members with an updating on very recent developments in his lecture
  titled, <q>Karmarkar’s linear programming algorithm and nonlinear programming</q>.
  The final speaker, Temple’s Leon Steinberg, spoke on <q>Simulation and the
  Monte Carlo method</q>. He based his remarks on the history and application of
  Monte Carlo methods from his vast years of experience as a mathematical
  consultant.
</p>
<p>
  Like the 1987 spring meeting, the 1989 version, whose theme was <q>Computer
  algebra systems</q>, consisted of three invited lectures and a panel discussion, this
  one devoted to <q>An introduction to computer algebra systems and their use in
  undergraduate mathematics education</q>. In the first talk, <q>Computer algebra using
  the HP28S,</q> John Kenelly described his department’s use of Hewlett Packard
  hand-held calculators, emphasizing the fact that these very powerful calculators
  placed symbolic calculation in the palms of his Clemson students. Next, Paul
  Zorn (St. Olaf) emphasized mathematical content and pedagogy rather than
  technical matters in his lecture titled, <q>Mathematica in undergraduate
  mathematics</q>. Zorn stated, <q>Although it seems obvious that computing should be
  a powerful force for change, so far that force has proved eminently resistible.
  Elementary calculus courses, for example, have hardly changed after 20 years of
  experiments with numerical computing. Symbolic computer systems, such as
  Mathematica, will be harder to ignore.</q> The purpose of the day’s remaining talk,
  <q>Computer algebra systems: Issues and inquiries,</q> by Warren Page (NY City
  Technical College) was <q>to initiate dialog and raise awareness of the many
  critical issues related to the introduction of CASs into the mathematics
  curriculum.</q>
</p>
<p>
  In his president’s message introducing the 1990 spring meeting, David Hill
  noted that the national MAA was about to embark on a series of new programs at
  the same time it looked to the past to celebrate the Association’s
  semisesquicentennial anniversary. He wrote, <q>Within EPADEL we hope to
  follow suit ... the spring meeting offers an opportunity for you to bring students
  and high school math teachers. The morning program on GEOMETRY should be
  especially appealing to a wide audience.</q> While that morning session was indeed
  appealing, in retrospect its introduction of the Visual Geometry Project was
  historic. The Project, under the direction of Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore) and
  Doris Schattschneider (Moravian), had been created in response to the
  widespread concern for the lack of 3-dimensional geometry in the schools. The
  former section presidents wrote, <q>Our multi-media approach seems of much
  broader applicability than our target high-school geometry population, and in
  particular some of our materials should be of use in a variety of college courses.
  In our presentation we will demonstrate some of the materials we have under
  development, including a videotape, some 3-dimensional models, and a computer
  program.</q>
</p>
<p>
  The presentation by Klotz and Schattschneider was followed by a computer-
  animated video by Eiji Hirai from Swarthmore College, and two lectures, the first
  by Cynthia Schmatzried on <q>The relationship of pre-college math to college
  mathematics: What should we be teaching secondary teachers?</q> and the second
  by Ann Fetter and Cynthia Schmatzried on <q>Hands-on models</q>. The final part of
  the morning session was a demonstration of The Geometer’s Sketchpad by its
  developers, Nicholas Jackiw and Eugene Klotz. The Geometer’s Sketchpad has
  been highly successful and is currently available commercially from Key
  Curriculum Press. (Incidentally, Key Curriculum’s president, Steven Rasmussen,
  holds two Temple degrees, a B.A. in mathematics in 1976 and a masters degree
  in mathematics education in 1978.)
</p>
<p>
  The afternoon session at the 1990 meeting consisted of two lectures – Paul
  Kumpel (SUNY - Stony Brook), <q>Untangling a bicycle chair</q>, and Andrew
  Hume (AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories), <q>Folding polyhedra and other computer
  databases</q>.
</p>
<p>
  The following year president Hill wrote, <q>The theme of this year’s spring
  meeting is Decision Sciences ... While there is significant movement to reform
  our calculus instruction format, there is ample reason to believe that a similar
  effort in elementary statistics instruction should be initiated at a variety of
  levels.</q> William E. Rosenthal addressed the same issue in his opening lecture,
  <q>No more sadistics [sic], no more sadists, no more victims</q>, in which he called
  for a radical reconstruction of the standard college-level elementary statistics
  course. Besides being a member of the mathematics department at Ursinus,
  Rosenthal was the co-coordinator of the College’s women’s studies program. In
  the final talk of the day, Temple statistician Janos Galambos, who had lectured
  on all continents except Antarctica, spoke on his specialty in a lecture titled,
  <q>Bonferroni-type inequalities: Fatigue failure of metals and the twin-prime
  conjecture</q>. The two lectures between Rosenthal and Galambos were by James
  M. Landwehr (AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories), <q>What should be in an introductory
  statistics course?</q> and Fred S. Roberts, <q>Meaningless statements</q>.
</p>
<p>
  The 1991 meeting also featured a new element at spring meetings, student
  paper sessions. Deborah Frantz (Kutztown) moderated two one-hour sessions that
  ran parallel to lectures given in the morning and the afternoon. The following
  year Lamarr Widmer (Messiah) ran a 21⁄2-hour session of student papers in the
  morning session. The theme of that year’s meeting, <q>Mathematical modeling</q>,
  was a reprise of the section’s inaugural spring meeting held at Gettysburg 15
  years earlier. Jefferson S. Hartzler (Penn State Harrisburg) began the day with an
  address whose title was congruent to the day’s theme. His lecture described, inter
  alia, a junior/senior modeling course developed for Messiah College and his own
  campus of Penn State. Next David (<q>Chris</q>) Arney (United States Military
  Academy) described the modeling course that formed the core of the four
  mathematics courses required of all cadets at West Point. After a discussion by
  Joseph H. Discenza (Daniel Wagner Associates) on modeling aspects of search
  problems about target a priori location, Ben A. Fusaro ended the day with a
  lecture on his specialty, environmental modeling. Fusaro included an outline of a
  six-week module appropriate for a general-education or liberal arts course.
</p>
<p>
  At the 1993 spring meeting, four lecturers described projects related to the
  day’s theme, <q>Improving mathematics learning</q>. All four talks reflected the
  change in perspective that was taking place in the mathematics community at the
  time – from an emphasis on instructors and teaching to an emphasis on students
  and learning. Two of the presentations described projects developed in
  classrooms in the EPADEL area. One was a joint presentation by Gerald J. Porter
  (Penn) and David R. Hill (Temple). Former EPADEL governor Porter began by
  describing an interactive linear algebra text the two speakers had written; he then
  related experiences in using it at Penn in what he called <q>Linear algebra AS a
  laboratory course</q>. Former EPADEL president Hill then described a similar
  course at Temple and contrasted it with Porter’s course. The distinction between
  the two can seen in the title Hill adopted, <q>Linear algebra WITH a laboratory
  course</q>. The other EPADEL speaker, Nancy Baxter (Dickinson), discussed
  design and implementation issues that arose when she adopted a lab-based,
  collaborative, constructivist approach to teaching functions, in her lecture
  <q>Teaching mathematics without learning</q>.
</p>
<p>
  The two outside speakers are well known for their involvement in
  undergraduate mathematics education. Cornell’s Beverly H. West described the
  interactive computer graphics she developed for use in calculus, linear algebra,
  and differential equations courses in a lecture titled <q>Integrating friendly graphics
  technology into the calculus curriculum</q>. In the remaining lecture, <q>Mathematics
  as a thinking subject,</q> Robert B. Davis (Rutgers) presented data obtained from
  school mathematics and innovative calculus courses that helped students learn
  mathematics in a reflective and analytical way.
</p>
<p>
  Once again the flexible format of the spring meeting allowed the organizers to
  insert yet another element into the mix. During the day William Hawkins (MAA)
  ran a two-hour SUMMA workshop on proposal preparation, and Deborah A.
  Frantz moderated two one-hour student-paper sessions. (SUMMA is the MAA
  program Strengthening Underrepresented Minority Mathematics Achievement.)
</p>
<p>
  The 1994 spring meeting was run in conjunction with PSMATYC, the
  Pennsylvania State Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges. President
  Walter Stromquist invited EPADEL members to <q>hear from Roseanne Hofmann
  and Stan Clemens on the use of graphing calculators, and from David A. Smith
  and Andy Gleason on their projects in calculus reform.</q> Stromquist then noted,
  <q>There will be parallel sessions of student presentations, including (a new
  emphasis) student papers on the teaching of mathematics.</q> <xref ref="Table29">Table</xref> lists

<p>
In announcing the theme for the 1995 meeting, Walter Stromquist wrote,
<q>Printed texts might be near the end of their run ... they may hang on for a while,
but students can now demand electronic tutorials ... fortunately for EPADEL,
much of the leadership in meeting this demand is coming from within our region.
Hence the attraction of the spring meeting, whose focus on interactive texts will
give us the best glimpse we are likely to get of the future of this technology.</q> To
begin the day, William J. Davis (Ohio State) described the interactive calculus
text called Calculus&amp;Mathematica. Then James E. White (UNC, Institute for
Academic Technology) described some of the design implications for computer-
based teaching and learning environments that were then emerging from
computational styles that included object orientation, graphical user interfaces,
and hypertext.
</p>
<p>
But it was the afternoon session that fulfilled Stromquist’s promise. He wrote,
<q>We are experimenting with a somewhat different format, in order to allow
attendees to sit at the keyboards and work directly with several of the most
promising interactive systems.</q> Four 20-minute presentations demonstrated the
systems Stromquist mentioned: Charles E. Hofmann (LaSalle) and Roseanne S.
Hofmann (Montgomery CCC), <q>Explorations in mathematics using MathKit,</q>
Jack R. Stodghill and Barry A. Tesman (both from Dickinson), <q>Mathematica-
based labs for calculus I, II, and III,</q> David R. Hill (Temple) and Gerald J. Porter
(Penn), <q>Interactive linear algebra in MathCAD,</q> and Charles E. Ashley
(Villanova), <q>Maple projects for differential equations and linear algebra</q>. Two
types of parallel sessions were conducted during these presentations – a 90-
minute student-paper session organized by Linda C. Thiel (Ursinus), and a series
of interactive demonstrations on MathKit, Mathematica, MathCAD, and Maple.
</p>
<p>
The 1996 meeting, devoted to active learning, returned to the theme from the
1993 meeting, improving mathematics learning. President Louise Berard wrote
beforehand, <q>Active learning at first may sound redundant because all learning IS
active. However, traditional classroom techniques often allow students to be
more passive than we would like regarding their educational experience. Our
invited speakers will share with us some important suggestions for engaging
students more actively in the learning process.</q>
</p>
<p>
Two of the four speakers came from the EPADEL section, with Louise’s
husband, Anthony D. Berard, Jr. (King’s College), leading off the program. His
lecture, <q>Applying logic/designing small axiom systems</q>, described a course in
which students worked in small groups in class to develop proofs together. He
ended his talk by supplying an example of an axiom system designed by first-
semester students. In the final talk of the day Nancy L. Hagelgans (Ursinus), the
former section president who was then the section’s governor, discussed
<q>Cooperative learning in discrete mathematics</q>. This talk described a
sophomore-level course in which students solved problems in three different
settings – using a computer algebra system by participating in groups during
class, in the computer laboratory, and outside scheduled hours. In the remaining
two lectures, E. Jacquelin Dietz (North Carolina State) presented two hands-on
activities that were developed to teach the concept of sampling distribution, while
Richard W. Decker (Hamilton College) described an introductory survey course
in computer science in his presentation <q>A suite of hands-on laboratory
exercises</q>.
</p>
<p>
The 1997 meeting duplicated the theme of that year’s Mathematics Awareness
Week – <q>Mathematics and the Internet</q>. The local highlight was Eugene Klotz’s
presentation with the fetching title, <q>How the WWW is taking over all of
mathematics and what you can do about it</q>. In the talk the former EPADEL
president surveyed old and new developments in the study of symmetry from
algebraic and geometric viewpoints. By the time of his lecture Klotz was known
internationally for his role in developing the highly successful Math Forum Web
site. Three other talks completed the program – Frank Wattenberg (Montana
State), <q>Using the WWW, Netscape, and Helper applications to create a learning
environment exploiting hands-on equipment, a CAS, Java, and the Internet to
study mathematics across the curriculum</q>, David Cerone (Union College),
<q>Mathematics on the Web: Looking back and looking forward</q>, and Frank
Beatrous (Pittsburgh), <q>The use of network resources in calculus instruction</q>.
</p>
<p>
The game theoretic theme for 1998 was addressed by three invited lectures.
Fan Chung Graham (Penn) discussed a variety of graph pebbling problems,
described some classic results, and mentioned several unsolved problems in her
talk titled, <q>Pebbling on graphs</q>. In the day’s opening address, Alan D. Taylor
(Union College) focused on game-theoretic approaches to the question of
whether honesty is the best policy in his lecture, <q>Strategic aspects of fair
division</q>. The third lecture, <q>Puzzles and paradoxes in game theory</q> by Ed
Packel (Lake Forest College), discussed four problems from game theory. The
remaining hour was comprised of contributed papers.
</p>
<p>
The 1999 meeting at Villanova was cosponsored by the Middle Atlantic
Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications Throughout the Curriculum
(MACMATC), so the day’s theme – mathematical applications throughout the
curriculum – is not surprising. The morning session offered 11 workshops, four
of which were offered by key members of our section: Annalisa Crannell (F &amp;
M), <q>The mathematics behind depth in drawings</q>; Joanne Darken (CCP),
<q>Precalculus in the here and now: Payoffs the same semester</q>; Linda Thiel
(Ursinus), <q>Life’s a risk!</q>; Dennis DeTurck and Larry Gladney (Penn),
<q>Moments of inertia – Integrated first-year calculus and physics</q>. The afternoon
session featured two keynote addresses – <q>Comparison with disclosure</q> by Peter
Winkler (Bell Labs) and <q>Slime molds, tiger bush, and bamboo</q> by Ben Bolker
(Princeton).
</p>
<p>
The first EPADEL meeting of the third millennium (or the last meeting of the
second millennium, depending on your viewpoint) was devoted to statistics.
Hence it was not by chance that two of the four speakers were graduates of the
host institution, Messiah College. Mark Heise B.A. 1986) spoke on <q>Statistics
and the drug development process</q>. As senior statistician at SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals, and formerly a statistician at Procter &amp; Gamble
Pharmaceuticals, Heise was particularly suited to discuss this topic. Tonya
Sharpe King (B.A. 1992) spoke on <q>The role of the statistician in the academic
research hospital setting</q>. Like Heise, her employment record certainly made her
well suited for the task because, after obtaining her Ph.D. in biostatistics, she
accepted an assistant professorship in biostatistics at Penn State’s College of
Medicine at the Hershey Medical Center.
</p>
<p>
President Douglas Ensley promised that the 2000 meeting would extend
beyond local success stories. He wrote, <q>The meeting features speakers known
nationally through the MAA.</q> One of the renowned speakers was Laurie Snell,
known primarily for his 1950s pioneering work in developing (with John G.
Kemeny and Gerald Thompson) the now-standard finite mathematics course and
writing the first book on the subject. In his talk Snell discussed his more recent
interest, Chance News, an electronic newsletter dealing with current news based
on probability and statistics. In the remaining talk, <q>Applications of MAPLE in
the instruction of probability and statistics</q>, Elliot A. Tanis (Hope College)
discussed ways to integrate the Computer Algebra System MAPLE into the
instruction of probability and statistics. He also illustrated some procedures that
helped to complete the statistical package in MAPLE.
</p>

<section><title>Profile: Gerald Joseph Porter</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Porter, Gerald Joseph</h></idx>
<p>
Jerry Porter’s introduction to the MAA was pure serendipity. It occurred when
David Rosen asked him to teach a seminar on algebraic topology at Swarthmore.
That is how the two EPADEL stalwarts got to know each other. Rosen was the
MAA governor at the time and he nominated Porter for the section’s Executive
Committee. The rest is, as they say, <q>history</q>. In looking back over his 30 years
of service to the MAA, Porter remarked, <q>I have a quote from Kundera on my
wall that says, ‘An individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence ... into a motif,
which then assumes a permanent position in the composition of the individual’s
life.’ (The Unbearable Lightness of Being) That pretty much describes my MAA
experience.</q>
</p>
<p>
And that pretty much describes the final EPADEL leader to be profiled.
</p>
<p>
Gerald Joseph Porter is a New Jersey native, born in Elizabeth on February
27, 1937, the son of Fred and Tillie Florence (Friedman) Porter. He attended
Princeton University, graduating with an A.B. in mathematics in 1958. Then he
enrolled in the graduate program at Cornell, earning a Ph.D. in 1963 for a
dissertation on Whitehead products, the first written under the supervision of
future <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> president William Browder. Algebraic topology and homotopy
theory, especially homotopy operations, would dominate his research during the
first part of his career.
</p>
<p>
Porter married Judith Deborah Revitch, who then transferred to Cornell.
Today she is a professor of sociology at Bryn Mawr College. The couple has
three children – Daniel, Rebecca, and Michael.
</p>
<p>
Upon graduation Porter went to MIT for two years as an instructor. Although
he accepted an assistant professorship at Penn in 1965, he spent his first year on
leave as a post-doctoral student at Brandeis on a fellowship from the Office of
Naval Research. He has remained at Penn ever since, except for the year 1969-
1970 spent at the Institute for Advanced Study. He was promoted to associate
professor in 1969 and to full professor in 1975.
</p>
<p>
The year 1971 marked Porter’s entry into administration, as he chaired the
undergraduate affairs division of the mathematics department for the next two
years. From 1981 to 1991 he was the associate dean for computing at Penn’s
School of Arts and Sciences. He was elected chair of the Faculty Senate in 1992,
which meant that he served a three-year term in office (chair elect for one year,
chair the next, and then past chair).
</p>
<p>
In 1983, Porter joined the MAA Investment Committee and this led to his
election to the MAA Finance Committee in 1986 and his subsequent election as
treasurer of the national association in 1992 and reelection in 1998. He will
leave this position in January 2002. He has been a member of the Board of
Governors since 1986. As a member of the Finance Committee and then as
treasurer he has served ex-officio on the Audit Committee, Budget Committee,
Building Committee, Publications Management Committee, Committee on
Meetings and the Committee on Management Evaluation and Oversight
(CMEO). He has chaired the Investment Committee since 1986 and the
Committee on Professional Development from 1995 to 2000 as well as the
Budget Committee, Committee on Meetings, and CMEO. In 2000 Doris
Schattschneider and he were awarded certificates of appreciation for their role
<q>in the installation of a very special mathematical tiling in the front lobby area</q>
of the MAA headquarters.
</p>
<p>
Jerry Porter has been a vital cog in EPADEL’s leadership for the past 30
years, beginning as a panel participant at the section’s 1970 meeting. He was
elected to a three-year term on the Executive Committee five years later. In 1979
he was the program chair for the spring meeting held at Penn, and the following
year he was elected to a three-year term as governor. In 1980 he also presented a
perspicacious address on <q>The future of the MAA</q>. Two years later he gave a
30-minute presentation on <q>Linear algebra in computer graphics</q> at the spring
meeting and moderated a panel discussion on CUPM recommendations at the fall
meeting. He has served on numerous nomination and program committees and is
currently the EPADEL Webmaster.
</p>
<p>
The spring EPADEL meetings in 1993 and 1995 saw joint presentations with
David Hill on interactive linear algebra texts. Sponsored by a FIPSE grant, this
pair developed an interactive text that was published by Springer-Verlag in 1996
under the title Interactive Linear Algebra.
</p>
<p>
Porter’s work on interactive texts is but one point in a long line of activity
regarding the role of computers in undergraduate education. We pursue the
outline of this line to show that life is really a journey rather than a sequence of
isolated events. The journey began in the summers of 1955 and 1956, when
Porter worked in a large insurance company that had just gotten its first
computer, an IBM 650. This led to a summer job with IBM in 1957 writing
subroutines to calculate trig functions and a part time job during the academic
year at the Institute for Advanced Studies as the night operator of the Von
Neumann computer. For his Princeton senior thesis his advisor, Harold Kuhn,
proposed a set of initial states and wanted to know which one provided the best
way to begin, so Porter used the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to solve linear
programming problems on an electronic computer. (In so doing, Porter may have
been the first Princeton undergraduate to use a computer on his senior thesis.)
</p>
<p>
However, that was the end of Porter’s involvement with computers or
computing for another ten years. Then at a colloquium party in 1968, Herb Wilf
and he decided that each of them would teach a section of computer calculus, a
new undertaking for the Penn math department. Porter’s goal was to use the
computer not simply as a computational engine but as a tool to help students get
a deeper understanding of the mathematics. That theme has persisted in his use of
the computer in undergraduate mathematics.
</p>
<p>
By 1973 Penn’s mathematics department had received an ILI grant that
provided typewriter terminals to the computer, which was a major step forward.
Even though the programs still ran in <q>batch mode</q> the turnaround was hours
instead of days. Eventually it became minutes. It became clear to Porter that
<q>printer graphics</q> were completely inadequate for showing the mathematics he
wanted to show, so he applied for, and received, an NSF grant for graphic
terminals. This led him to organize, and speak at, the 1979 EPADEL spring
meeting on computer graphics.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of the Apple II microcomputer the following year, Porter saw
at once that educational uses on the mainframe were obsolete. He applied for an
NSF grant to increase substantially the number of microcomputers on campus
and to provide support for faculty to develop programs for their use in education,
but by 1981 a change in presidential priorities essentially put NSF out of the
education business. Nonetheless, Porter’s involvement in the proposal led the
dean to ask him to be the second associate dean for computing in the School of
Arts and Sciences. Porter served in that position for ten years. This activity
caused MAA president Lynn Steen to ask him to chair CCIME, resulting in a
spate of talks around the country on the use of computers in undergraduate
mathematics education. In 1989 he organized the EPADEL spring meeting on
<q>The role of Computer Algebra Systems in teaching mathematics</q>.
</p>
<p>
Porter left the dean’s office after 10 years but he continued his involvement in
this area with the MAA. One grant provided equipment and support for the
Interactive Mathematics Text Project. This led to the interactive text with David
Hill. Of course Porter’s activities did not stop there. Since then he has helped the
MAA begin the math digital library, MathDL, that now includes the journal he
dubbed JOMA, the <em>Journal of Online Mathematics and Its Applications</em>.
