graduated summa cum laude with a degree in mathematics and physics
from the University of Pennsylvania, and he earned his PhD from
M.I.T. with a dissertation in analytic number theory under Harold
Stark. In 1983, after a stint as the Lawton Lecturer at Temple
University, Styer joined the faculty of Villanova University, where he
taught a wide range of courses and held many positions in university
leadership, including Chair of the Department of Mathematics Sciences
(later the Department of Mathematics and Statistics) (1997-2003),
Chair of the University Senate (2008-2014). He has been the Director
of the Comprehensive Science program since 2011 and expects to remain
in that position until about 2026.
      </p>
<p>
Styer served as EPADEL President (2007-2009), multiple terms as an
At-Large member of the Executive Committee, and was a local organizer
for section meetings in spring of 1999, fall of 2005, and fall of
2016. He has been active in promoting mathematics and science in the
Philadelphia area, having taught a course on the Elementary and Middle
School Math Olympiads, coordinated the MAA AMC/AIME exams for
homeschoolers and was involved with two NSF Education grants to assist
teachers with STEM education training.

        College with a major in Mathematics and Secondary Education
        before doing her graduate work at Lehigh University. In 2002,
        she completed her PhD in Probability and Mathematical Finance
        under the direction of Vladimir Dobric.

        Lisa took a tenure-track position at LaSalle University
        immediately upon graduation from Lehigh University, but the
        following year she moved into a tenure-track position at West
        Chester University. She has remained at WCU to this date,
        moving through the academic ranks and founding the West
        Chester University Actuarial Science program. She is currently
        Associate Dean for the College of Mathematics and Sciences.

      Within EPADEL, Lisa served in the elected positions of Vice
      Chair, Chair, and Section Representative after serving in the
      Executive Committee from 2005 – 2007 as an at-large
      member. Before that she served as one of the coordinators of
      Section NExT. In that role, along With Kate McGivney, she
      secured funding for joint programming with AMATYC’s Project
      ACCCESS.

        Lisa has the distinction of being the last occupant of two
        positions within EPADEL. While she was serving as Section
        President in 2008 EPADEL's By Laws were updated and the title
        was changed to "Chair."  She was also serving as Section
        Governor when the 2017 MAA By Laws update changed that title
        to "Section Representative to MAA Congress." Starting in 2018
        Lisa has been a member of the MAA's Board of Directors as a
        consequence of serving as the Chair of the Committee on
        Sections.

        Section of the MAA where he served in various leadership roles
        between 1996 and 2006 when he moved to Penn State’s Harrisburg
        campus (Capital College). Because Penn State campuses are
        split between two MAA sections this move made him a member of

          towns of Bensalem and Holland). She had to switch schools in
          her very early years and because of inconsistencies in the

        Ellen has the dubious and unsought distinction of being the

        became chair just after to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
        and unfortunately, the pandemic coincided almost exactly with
        Ellen’s time as Chair so she was never able to preside over a
        physical meeting of the section.

        was born in Rahway, NJ, and for most of her youth, she aspired
        to become an artist. After tutoring her best friend in high
        school, mathematics won her over, but she has maintained love
        for both mathematics and art for her whole career. Trisha
        earned a BS in Mathematics and Secondary Education from
        Trenton State College (now The College of NJ) in 1997, and
        then worked for AT&amp;T for a year before enrolling in the
        graduate program at Lehigh University.  In 2004 Trisha earned
        her PhD in Mathematics from Lehigh University with a
        dissertation in graph theory under the guidance of Garth
        Isaak. It was in graduate school at Lehigh University that
        Trisha met and married fellow mathematician, Mike
        Fraboni. After a start on the tenure track at DeSales
        University, Trisha transitioned to full-time mom and part-time
        professor with the birth of her two sons. Trisha has held many
        positions on the EPADEL executive committee such as Section
        NExT coordinator, chair of the Committee on the Session for
        New Colleagues, Student Speaker Coordinator, Public
        Information Officer, and organizer of the 2005 EPADEL Student
        Career Conference. Trisha is a 2004 MAA Project NExT fellow,
        and in 2011, she earned the AAUW Bethlehem Emerging Star
        Award. In 2021, the Calypso Elementary Dr. Trisha Moller
        Leadership Award was established in her honor.
