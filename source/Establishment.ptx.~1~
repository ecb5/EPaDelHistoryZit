  <title>Establishment, <m>1926-1932</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter describes activities in the Philadelphia Section
      from the time of the organizational meeting in <m>1926</m> to
      the annual meeting in <m>1932</m>. We refer to this as the
      <q>period of establishment</q> because the energy that was
      initially expended to organize the section in <m>1926</m> was
      directed over the next six years to establish it as a thriving
      organization whose continuity and vitality were assured. Over
      this period, the section benefited from the emergence of a new
      set of energetic leaders who sustained it well into the 1930s,
      thus guaranteeing the permanence of its activities and the
      success of future endeavors. We profile several of the new
      leaders and describe their sectional activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter also examines the genesis of many of the traditions
      that now define the section, including the governance structure
      and the format of annual meetings. Our analysis of the five
      meetings that took place from <m>1928</m> to <m>1932</m> serves
      as a model for subsequent analyses of other periods in the
      section’s history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of any professional organization depends not only on
      its leadership but also on the vitality of its membership, whom
      Arnold Dresden called the <q>rank and file</q>. This chapter
      confirms such a paradigm by providing brief accounts of the
      lives and contributions of several <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members who graced the
      Philadelphia Section with a diversity of mathematical interests,
      abilities, and contributions.

      The first column of <xref ref="FirstSeven">Table</xref> lists
      the dates of the first seven meetings.  Nowadays the section
      holds its annual fall meeting in the early part of November, but
      initially the date was scheduled for the Saturday following
      Thanksgiving. It was not until the meeting of 1939 that this
      original tradition was formally enacted, when the assembled
      members voted to hold meetings <q>on the Saturday after the
      official Thanksgiving Day of Pennsylvania.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second column of <xref ref="FirstSeven">Table</xref> lists
      the sites of the first seven meetings. They bear out the
      section’s elliptical model of focal points in the Lehigh Valley
      and Philadelphia. Overall the University of Pennsylvania hosted
      four meetings sandwiched between two at Lehigh University;
      Swarthmore College, located in suburban Philadelphia, hosted the
      seventh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Founding">Chapter</xref> reported that <m>20</m>
      people attended the November 1926 organization meeting of the
      Philadelphia Section held at Lehigh, including the 14 charter
      members of the section. With the bulk of the section’s <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> membership living in the
      Philadelphia area, the site of the meetings was moved to Penn
      for the next four years. Columns 3, 4, and 5 of <xref
      ref="FirstSeven">Table</xref> provide attendance figures at
      these meetings:
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Column 3 (header #)</em> lists total attendance</li>
      <li><em>Column 4 (header <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>)</em> states the number of <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members</li>
      <li><em>Column 5 (header %)</em> gives the percentage of <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="FirstSeven">Table</xref> shows that the absolute
      number and the percentage of <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members who attended these
      meetings varied appreciably. The table also shows that initially
      the move to the Philadelphia area witnessed a surge in
      attendance, but that the figures dropped precipitously from a
      peak of 75 in 1928 to only 39 just two years later. A likely
      explanation for this decline is the stock market crash that
      intervened between the two meetings. With transportation
      presenting a greater obstacle than today, it is not surprising
      that the two meetings held at Lehigh attracted smaller audiences
      than those held in the Philadelphia area, where a network of
      trains, trolleys, buses, and subway lines minimized
      transportation inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, during the seven-year period the mean attendance was
      <m>50.3</m>, of whom <m>28.6</m> (<m>57.4</m>%) belonged to the
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. Ignoring the
      organizational meeting of <m>1926</m>, which statisticians might
      label an outlier, the mean attendance at the remaining six
      meetings was <m>55.3</m>, of whom <m>31.3</m> (<m>56.6</m>%)
      were members of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.

    <title>Leaders</title>
    <p>
      As we have noted, every successful professional organization
      depends upon a small cadre of leaders to get it started and to
      plan a program of activities, as well as a large contingent of
      adherents who support and sustain those efforts. In this section
      we profile the officers and several other leaders of the section
      from 1926 through 1932. We identify their academic affiliations
      in order to reinforce the geographic spread throughout the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Table2">Table</xref> addresses the section’s
      governance structure in this period. At the organizational
      meeting at Lehigh in 1926 it was decided that two officers
      should govern the section. Not surprisingly, two of the founders
      were elected to the initial offices, Howard Mitchell as chairman
      and Albert Bennett as vice-chairman/secretary-treasurer. The
      following year a Program Committee was formed to assist the
      officers in planning the following year’s annual meeting.

    <p>
      During the period <m>1926-1932</m> the Philadelphia Section had
      <m>15</m> different leaders who either held office or served on
      the Program Committee. Their academic affiliations reflect the
      geographical diversity of the section. Of the section’s three
      founders, only H. H. Mitchell continued to provide leadership,
      although he never held another elected office in the
      section. Bennett moved to Brown University the following
      year. As we will see, Reynolds continued to participate in
      sectional activities, even being elected chairman in
      <m>1938</m>. However, he never attended a meeting outside the
      Lehigh Valley area, not even in <m>1938</m>, though he did
      ensure that the 1939 meeting, over which he would preside, was
      held at his home institution of Lehigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of Bennett’s departure and Reynolds’ apparent
      unwillingness to travel to the Philadelphia area, it was
      necessary for a new group of individuals to assume the mantle of
      leadership if the section was to survive, let alone thrive.
      Moreover, this group had to emerge quickly. Fortunately the
      section boasted many energetic, capable mathematicians who were
      willing to grab the reins.

      It always has.

    <p>
      <xref ref="Table2">Table</xref> lists three different
      secretaries of the section. After Albert Bennett completed his
      term, the title <q>vice-chairman</q> was dropped when
      J. R. Kline of the University of Pennsylvania was elected
      secretary-treasurer. The following year even the designation
      <q>treasurer</q> was dropped when P. A. Caris of Penn was
      elected as secretary. Caris held this position from <m>1928</m>
      to <m>1941</m>.

      <p> 
        <em>Each year refers to the November in which elections are

        <alert>Perry Aquila Caris</alert> (<m>1890-1966</m>) is a
        native of Tylersville, PA. He spent a lifetime working his way
        up the academic ladder. Caris received two degrees from
        Bucknell University, a bachelors in <m>1913</m> and a masters
        in <m>1917</m>. He held an instructorship at Bucknell from
        <m>1913</m> to <m>1915</m>, which explains the four-year
        period between degrees. Besides, from <m>1916</m> to
        <m>1925</m> Caris taught at various high schools in the state,
        including West Philadelphia H. S. for boys. All the while he
        pursued graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania,
        where he was awarded a Ph.D. in <m>1925</m> for a dissertation
        comprised of several papers he had published in the interim on
        the theory of numbers and analytic geometry. His doctorate was
        the very last one granted at Penn for a dissertation lacking a
        formal supervisor. That same year he accepted an assistant
        professorship at Penn, where he remained until retirement in
        1960. Caris is the author, with E. S. Crawley, of the 1933
        textbook A First Course in Calculus. In addition to writing
        several articles in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, he was
        cited for vital contributions to the Committee to Review the
        Activities of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in
        the late 1930s. In <m>1959</m> Penn awarded him a prize of
        $<m>1000</m> for <q>excellence in undergraduate teaching.</q>
        Caris died in <m>1966</m> at age <m>76</m> after having been a
        member of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> for
        <m>43</m> years.

      <xref ref="Table2">Table</xref> lists seven different people who
      served as chairmen during this seven- year period, a sure sign
      of a healthy organization. Indeed, these seven stand at the
      forefront of a long line of dedicated individuals who have given
      freely of their time and energy. Although the national <url

      by-laws to lengthen the term of the President to two years, the
      Philadelphia Section decided on one-year terms, a practice that
      persists today, although since the <m>1960</m>s most chairs have served
      two one-year terms. The founder and first chairman, H. H.
      Mitchell, was profiled in <xref ref="Founding">
      Chapter</xref>. Here we provide biographical sketches of the six
      other chairmen in the order of their terms.

        <alert>Frederick William Owens</alert> (<m>1880-1961</m>) was
        born in Iowa and received his B.S. degree from the University
        of Kansas in <m>1902</m>. He continued graduate studies at
        Kansas, where he met and married fellow graduate student Helen
        Barten Brewster (<m>1881-1968</m>). Both Frederick and Helen
        Owens then enrolled in the graduate program at the University
        of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. degree in <m>1907</m> under
        the estimable E. H. Moore. Then he accepted an instructorship
        at Cornell University, where Helen B. Owens continued her
        graduate studies, obtaining a Ph.D. in <m>1910</m> under the
        department chairman, Virgil Snyder. In <m>1926</m> the couple
        moved to Penn State, where Frederick became head of the
        department, a position he held until his retirement in
        <m>1949</m>. Although he was unable to attend the
        organizational meeting of the section in <m>1926</m>, held
        just a few months after he moved to State College, he did
        travel to Philadelphia for the second meeting and was rewarded
        with election as the section’s second chairman. Not only did
        Helen Owens accompany him to that meeting, but there is no
        record of the either one of them ever attending a meeting
        without the other. Helen herself had two careers, one as a
        suffragette (fighting for women’s rights in both New York and
        Kansas), and, later, as a mathematician (she was an associate
        editor of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> and taught at Penn
        State <m>1941-1949</m>). When she died in 1968 she had been an
        <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> member for <m>49</m>
        years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Albert Harris Wilson</alert> (<m>1872-1958</m>) was
        born in Tennessee. After receiving a B.S. degree in
        <m>1892</m> from Vanderbilt University, A. H. Wilson spent the
        next three years in the graduate program at Johns Hopkins
        University.  During the first academic year, <m>1892-1893</m>,
        he was a Fellow and obtained a masters degree. He left the
        program two years later, without taking another degree, to
        accept an instructorship at Princeton University. He left
        Princeton for the year <m>1899-1900</m> to study in
        Göttingen. He came to Haverford College as an associate
        professor in 1910. In the meantime Wilson studied under the
        renowned Leonard Dickson at the University of Chicago, earning
        his doctorate in <m>1911</m>. He remained at Haverford College
        for the rest of his life, retiring as professor emeritus in
        <m>1939</m>. He was a charter member of the national <url
        href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> when it was formed in
        <m>1915</m>. Wilson died in <m>1958</m> at the age of
        <m>86</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>John Anthony Miller</alert> (<m>1859-1946</m>) was born
        in Indiana. After graduating from high school there, he taught
        in the public schools for several years before taking his
        bachelors degree at Indiana University in <m>1890</m> at age
        <m>30</m>.  One year later he accepted an instructorship at
        Stanford, which was just opening that year. A famous student
        in his first class was Herbert Hoover.  Miller took graduate
        courses at Stanford, resulting in a masters degree in
        <m>1893</m>. The following year he returned to Indiana
        University as professor of mathematics. He seems to have
        become interested in applications because, after only one
        year, he switched from mathematics to the department of
        mechanics and astronomy, where he remained until
        <m>1906</m>. In the meantime he enrolled at the University of
        Chicago. In <m>1899</m>, at age <m>39</m>, he earned his
        Ph.D. as Heinrich Maschke’s first doctoral student. Seven
        years later Miller accepted the positions of professor of
        astronomy and Director of the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore
        College; he held both for the next <m>26</m> years.  When he
        was elected our section’s fourth chairman in <m>1929</m>, at
        age <m>70</m>, he not only held two academic positions, he
        also served as Vice President at Swarthmore (since
        <m>1914</m>). In that same year Indiana University bestowed an
        honorary doctorate upon him. Miller’s retirement in
        <m>1932</m> did not equate to lack of work, as evidenced by
        the <m>1935</m> publication of the second edition of his book
        <pubtitle>Analytic Mechanics</pubtitle>, which appeared
        initially in <m>1915</m>. In <m>1937</m> an appreciative group
        of Swarthmore alumni initiated the Miller Student Loan Fund in
        his honor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Tomlinson Fort</alert> (<m>1886-1970</m>) was born in
        Georgia and received two degrees from the University of
        Georgia, a bachelors in <m>1906</m> and a masters in
        <m>1909</m>.  He then enrolled in the graduate program at
        Harvard University, earning his Ph.D. in <m>1912</m> under
        Maxime B&#244;cher. Fort was a faculty member at Lehigh
        University from 1927 to <m>1945</m>, serving as Dean of the
        Graduate School from <m>1938</m> to <m>1945</m>. After that he
        taught at Georgia, South Carolina, Miami (Fla.), and
        Emory. His election in <m>1930</m> marked the first time a
        chairman of the Philadelphia Section had come from the Lehigh
        Valley and undoubtedly explains why the annual meeting
        returned to Bethlehem the next year after four years in
        Philadelphia. Fort also served three consecutive terms on the
        Program Committee from <m>1928</m> through <m>1931</m>. Later
        he was elected vice- president of the national <url
        href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. He died in <m>1970</m>
        at the age of 83, having been a member of the <url

        <alert>Arnold Dresden</alert> (<m>1882-1954</m>) was born in
        the Netherlands and came to the U. S. in <m>1903</m>. In
        <m>1905</m> he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he
        received his Ph.D. four years later under Oskar Bolza. Upon
        graduation he accepted an assistant professorship at the
        University of Wisconsin, where he remained until moving to
        Swarthmore in <m>1927</m>. When he retired in <m>1952</m>, his
        replacement was future EPADEL governor David Rosen. Dresden
        died in <m>1954</m> at age <m>71</m>. (See the profile of
        Arnold Dresden at the end of the chapter.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>John Robert Kline</alert> (<m>1891-1955</m>) was
        arguably the best mathematician among all leaders of the
        Philadelphia Section during the period of establishment. A
        <m>1912</m> graduate of Muhlenberg College, Kline earned the
        distinction of being R. L. Moore’s first doctoral student when
        he received his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in
        <m>1916</m>. Except for brief stints at Yale and the
        University of Illinois, Kline spent the remainder of his life
        at Penn, where he supervised <m>19</m> doctoral dissertations
        from <m>1925</m> to <m>1954</m>, including <url
        href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> stalwarts Harry Gehman
        and Lida Barrett. (See the profile of J. R. Kline at the end
        of the chapter.)

<p>
      The final column of <xref ref="Table2">Table</xref> lists the
      members of the Program Committee, which came into existence at
      the second meeting, held in November 1927. Two years later it
      was decided to make the section’s chairman an ex-officio member
      of the committee. As the name connotes, the Program Committee
      was charged with planning the program for the next year’s annual
      meeting. In 1953 it evolved into the Executive Committee; in
      1968 the newly created post of vice-chairman was put in charge
      of organizing annual meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of the Program Committee during this period proved
      amazingly beneficial to the section. Of the dozen different
      individuals elected to the committee during this period, ten
      would ultimately become chairmen of the section. We have already
      provided sketches of J. A. Miller, (who was chairman in
      <m>1929</m>), Tomlinson Fort (<m>1930</m>), Arnold Dresden
      (<m>1931</m> and <m>1940</m>), and J. R.  Kline
      (<m>1932</m>). Subsequent chapters will sketch the lives of
      William Mackey (<q>Will</q>) Smith (<m>1933</m>) from Lafayette,
      Richard Morris (<m>1934</m>) from Rutgers, John Wentworth
      Clawson (<m>1935</m>) from Ursinus, and George Emil Raynor
      (<m>1948</m>) from Lehigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the union of the sets of chairmen, secretaries, and
      members of the Program Committee supplies us with <m>15</m>
      different individuals who provided strong leadership throughout
      the seven-year period of establishment. Their academic
      affiliations are diverse. Four of the leaders hailed from the
      Lehigh Valley: Bennett, Fort, and Raynor from Lehigh and Smith
      from Lafayette. Three came from the Penn: Caris, Kline, and
      Mitchell. Moreover, the suburban Philadelphia area provided four
      leaders from three small colleges: Dresden and Miller from
      Swarthmore, Wilson from neighboring Haverford, and Clawson from
      Ursinus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the <m>15</m> individuals were from areas that no
      longer lie within the section’s boundary. Orrin Frink and
      Frederick W. Owens, from the Pennsylvania State College,
      represented central Pennsylvania. Their participation in the
      Philadelphia Section would diminish, but not disappear, with the
      establishment of the Allegheny Section in
      <m>1933</m>. Similarly, Richard Morris of Rutgers College
      represented southern New Jersey, an area that remained part of
      the Philadelphia Section until <m>1956</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We observe the lack of leadership initially from the state of
      Delaware and from areas north and west of the Lehigh
      Valley. That situation would change in Delaware in the
      <m>1940</m>s but would take a longer period of time for the more
      geographically remote locations of the section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official records from meetings of the Philadelphia Section up to
      <m>1954</m> include complete lists of all <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members in attendance. In
      general we make no attempt to analyze these lists, but in this
      case we present a brief analysis in order to gain a greater
      understanding of the breadth of the mathematical community in
      the Philadelphia area during the roaring 20s. Then, as now, all
      who attended the meetings basked in camaraderie with fellow
      mathematics teachers. This camaraderie was more valuable at that
      time than today because only the University of Pennsylvania and
      Lehigh University contained more than a handful of
      mathematicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two individuals attained perfect attendance at the first seven
      meetings – A. H.  Wilson (who was profiled above), and
      P. A. Knedler.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Paul Allen Knedler</alert> (pronounced need-ler;
        <m>1900-1972</m>) was born in East Texas and graduated from
        the Keystone Normal School in <m>1917</m>. Knedler earned a
        bachelors degree from Muhlenberg College and a masters degree
        from the University of Pennsylvania. During his career he held
        various positions. Initially he was a teacher at a high school
        teacher in New Jersey from <m>1920</m> to <m>1928</m>. He then
        became an instructor at Penn, remaining there until
        <m>1932</m>, when he moved to Kutztown State Teacher’s College
        (now Kutztown University). Knedler remained at Kutztown as
        associate professor until his retirement in
        <m>1969</m>. During his tenure he served as chairman of the
        mathematics department for many years. He also taught classes
        in astronomy, resulting in the university naming part of its
        science building in his honor – the Gruber-Knedler Planetarium
        and Observatory.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      Next, we provide sketches of three other members of the section
      who attended frequent meetings.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Edwin Schofield Crawley</alert> (<m>1862-1933</m>)
        attended five of the first seven meetings. Crawley is a native
        Philadelphian who received his bachelors degree from the
        University of Pennsylvania in <m>1882</m>. He then became an
        instructor in the Department of Civil Engineering at Penn. In
        <m>1885</m> he switched to the Department of
        Mathematics. Crawley was married in <m>1888</m> and resided in
        the city of Philadelphia his entire life. In <m>1892</m> he
        was awarded the first Ph.D. in mathematics that Penn ever
        granted. No dissertation supervisor is recorded for his
        thesis; it was common practice at the time to fashion a
        dissertation as a collection of published articles so there
        was no need to acknowledge any special guidance provided by a
        senior member of the department. In 1899 he was appointed to
        the Thomas A.  Scott professorship of mathematics. Today the
        Department of Mathematics at Penn dates its modern period from
        the appointment of E. S. Crawley as head of the department. To
        commemorate this date the department sponsored a celebration
        on October <m>30</m>, <m>1999</m>, called <q>A Century of Math
        at Penn</q>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>George Abram Harter</alert> (<m>1853-1943</m>) was born
        in Maryland. He became an assistant professor of mathematics
        and Latin at St. John’s College (Maryland) after earning his
        bachelors degree there in <m>1878</m>. He remained in this
        position until receiving his masters degree two years
        later. From then until <m>1885</m> he was a principal at two
        different schools. In the meantime he was awarded a Ph.D. from
        St. John’s College in <m>1882</m>. Harter joined the faculty
        of Delaware College (now the University of Delaware) in
        <m>1885</m>.  Initially he was a professor of mathematics and
        modern languages, but, after three years, physics replaced
        languages. In <m>1896</m> he was chosen as President of the
        University of Delaware, a position he held until
        <m>1914</m>. Subsequent chapters will record several other
        instances of Delaware mathematicians rising to top positions
        in the university administration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Albert Eugene Meder, Jr.,</alert> was born in
        <m>1903</m> in New York City, where he attended Columbia
        University, receiving an A.B. in <m>1922</m> and an A.M. in
        <m>1923</m>. He spent <m>1922-1926</m> on Columbia’s faculty
        before moving to Rutgers University, where he remained for the
        rest of his career. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty in
        <m>1945</m>, which explains why he was referred to as Dean
        A. E. Meder in subsequent literature. Earlier in his tenure at
        Rutgers, Meder held two administrative positions at the New
        Jersey College for Women, Acting Dean <m>1932-1934</m> and Admissions
        Officer <m>1933-1934</m>. This helps to explain why the New Jersey
        College for Women at Rutgers hosted the annual meeting of the
        Philadelphia Section in <m>1933</m>. Meder helped found the New
        Jersey Section in <m>1956</m>. He was elected that section’s first
        chairman during the year <m>1956-1957</m>; he held the position again
        <m>10</m> years later. The report of a panel he chaired at the
        section’s second meeting, <q>The education of mathematics
        teachers</q>, was published in the
        <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> in <m>1959</m>. Meder also served
        on several <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>
        committees. According to a reviewer, his 1967 pamphlet Topics
        from Inversive Geometry <q>was apparently designed for high
        school students ... [but] would be enlightening to many
        college students.</q> Today Dean Meder is retired and living
        in Manchester, Vermont.

<p>
      At the other end of the attendance scale, Joseph Reynolds, whose idea sparked
      the founding of the section, attended only two meetings, both held at Lehigh, his
      home institution. Two other charter members of the section, Rollin L. Charles of
      Franklin &amp; Marshall and Victor H. Doushkess of Lafayette, attended only the
      organizational meeting.

    <p>
      <xref ref="Table3"> Table </xref> lists the five invited speakers at the very first meeting of the
      Philadelphia Section, held November <m>27</m>, <m>1926</m>, at Lehigh University. There are
      several ways in which this meeting differed from all others. For instance, three of
      the five speakers were associated with institutions in the Lehigh Valley, two from
      Lehigh University. One of them, Joseph Reynolds, was given the opportunity to
      be the section’s very first speaker in honor of his role in founding the section.
      The second speaker was Howard Mitchell, another founder. Leroy Smail and
      Will Smith were the other two speakers from the Lehigh Valley, with Smail from
      Lehigh and Smith from Lafayette. Mitchell hailed from Penn.

      for Pennsylvania who had been a co-chairman of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>’s National
      Committee on Mathematical Requirements. In the introduction to his talk Foberg
      expressed his view on the section’s role in pre-college education. He stated, <q>The
      attention consistently given by the Mathematical Association to the interests of
      mathematical instruction in the secondary school makes it appropriate that
      discussion of mathematics instruction in the public schools should form part of
      the program of this initial meeting of the Philadelphia Section.</q> Foberg told the
      audience that <q>mathematics is a required study through the first nine school years
      – thereafter it is elective.</q> Nonetheless, <q>the state program of studies in
      Pennsylvania contemplates a continuous twelve-year program in such major
      subjects as mathematics.</q> His concluding remarks encouraged a symbiotic
      relationship between high school teachers and college professors. <q>A number of
      colleges and universities in Pennsylvania now admit applicants upon a showing
      of twelve units of work done in the three-year senior high school. It is hoped and
      expected that this plan will become general in the near future.</q>

      Three of the other four lectures dealt with themes from the undergraduate
      curriculum. Joseph Reynolds spoke about a topic from analytic geometry, a
      subject that was then a typical second-year course taken before calculus.
      Reynolds demonstrated nine properties of a curve and its evolutes for analytic
      symmetrical plane curves having continuous evolutes, one infinite branch, and no
      point singularities. He presented the parabola as an example of the type of curve
      he was discussing.

      Smail and Smith lectured on topics from an undergraduate analysis course.
      Smail, who became known for his highly successful calculus book, presented
      material at the boundary of graduate and undergraduate education. He introduced
      a modified form of Dedekind’s definition of irrational numbers to treat rational
      and irrational exponents and logarithms without explicit use of the theory of
      limits. Smith’s topic fit neatly into the undergraduate curriculum as enrichment
      material for the usual course in differential equations. He presented an expository
      account of the derivation of various kinds of differential equations, including the
      Riccati equation, equations of forced, damp vibrations, and certain others with
      solutions <q>arising from a kind of maintained vibration in which the force of
      restitution ... is subject to an imposed periodic variation.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one of the lectures appears to be at the graduate level, meaning that it
      was aimed mainly for the edification of the college professors in the audience. In
      the talk Howard Mitchell discussed the determination of the number of classes of
      ideals in quadratic fields by methods used in the theory of binary quadratic
      forms.

      At the time of the 1927 meeting the 65-year old Edwin S. Crawley held the
      distinguished Thomas A. Scott Professorship in Mathematics at the University of
      Pennsylvania. On this occasion he reflected on the history of mathematics by
      sketching the contents of The Geometry, the historic work that was one of three
      influential appendices to Descartes’ monumental Discourse on Reasoning
      (1637). Crawley described Descartes’ introduction and use of coordinates in the
      construction of a normal to a curve. In the sense that the topic was on analytic
      geometry, the first paper at this meeting was similar to the first paper at the
      organizational meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second speaker, Frederick Owens, traveled from State College to attend
      the meeting, probably by train via Lewistown and Harrisburg on the Friday
      between Thanksgiving and the date of the meeting. In his presentation Owens
      gave a historical sketch of the Malfatti problem: to construct three circles in a
      triangle such that each circle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and to the
      other two circles. Owens concluded with his own solution to the problem, which
      differed from those usually given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong historical flavor of the talks by Crawley and Owens would enable
      them to be understood by advanced undergraduate students. The same is true of
      the presentation by Lehigh’s Tomlinson Fort, who outlined the history and
      literature of difference equations and stated the principal problems as well. It
      should be noted that Fort <q>dwelt upon the advances in difference equations which
      have been made in America</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presentation by Haverford College’s Albert H. Wilson was similar to
      Fort’s in that his topic has never been part of the mathematical mainstream, and
      so can be considered as an enrichment topic. Nonetheless, this author wishes that
      Wilson’s talk could have been taped, for it must have been a sight to behold. He
      began his lecture by discussing tilings of the plane, a topic that received a major
      boost in the 1970s with the work of the Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Our own Doris
      Schattschneider of Moravian College has added immensely to the popularization
      of this topic and to our understanding and appreciation of it. Unlike
      Schattschneider, however, Wilson restricted his tilings to polygons, enumerating
      classes of polygons that tile based on the work of the English mathematician
      Percy Alexander MacMahon. (Incidentally, George Andrews discussed other
      results due to Major MacMahon in an invited lecture given 73 years later, in
      2000.) Then Wilson moved to tilings of three-dimensional space by prisms, the
      rhombic dodecahedron, the bees’-cell, and the tetrakaidecahedron, showing
      models of each and indicating their significance in nature. In the conclusion of
      what must have been a captivating lecture for the 60 people in attendance,
      Wilson discussed the work from a related problem in non-Euclidean geometry as
      well as Euclidean geometry. Models too accompanied this final part, this time
      four tetrahedra that tile Euclidean space. The question of which tetrahedra tile
      space is still unsolved, but there are many known families of such tetrahedra.

      Lectures by Swarthmore’s Arnold Dresden and Rutgers’ Richard Morris
      presented recent results at a research level. The mix of undergraduate and
      graduate levels, with a wide variety of topics, became standard fare at all
      sectional meetings after this one. The challenge of the Program Committee at that
      time and the Executive Committee today is to attract a program of capable
      speakers who reflect this diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dresden gave a brief report on a method recently developed by W. E. Roth at
      the University of Wisconsin for determining solutions of the matrix equation
      <m>P(X) = A</m> which are expressible as polynomials in <m>A</m>, where <m>P(\lambda)</m> is a
      polynomial in <m>\lambda</m> without a constant term, <m>A</m> is a given matrix of order <m>n</m>, and <m>X</m> is
      the unknown matrix of order <m>n</m>. The fact that Dresden based his talk on work
      done at Wisconsin combined with Fort’s emphasis on contributions made by
      American mathematicians reflects a heartfelt pride in achievements by their
      fellow countrymen.

      In the final talk of the day Richard Morris discussed a problem in Diophantine

</p>
<p>
<xref ref="Table5">Table</xref> shows that <m>8</m> of the <m>23</m>
talks sponsored by the section in this period dealt with topics in the
broad area of analysis, with at least one given each year.  However,
all eight lectures covered topics that can be considered classical
analysis, not the emerging area of functional analysis.
</p>
<p>
Penn State’s Orrin Frink presented talks at the first and last meeting of this
five-year period. In 1928 he described a method of obtaining formulas from
differential calculus without the use of any limiting process. Frink wrote that his
method differed from early writers on the calculus by <q>being rigorous</q>; it was, in
fact, based on the theory of analytic functions of a hyper-complex variable. One
can only wonder what the successful calculus textbook author Lloyd Smail
thought of this stinging critique while seated in the audience.
</p>
<p>
Smail, a charter member of the Philadelphia Section, had spoken at the
organizational meeting. Five years later, in 1931, he talked again at the second
meeting held at Lehigh. This time it was Smail’s turn to criticize calculus
textbook authors, asserting that a definition due to Konrad Knopp was the only
satisfactory alternative to the usual textbook definitions of infinite series. Smail
proposed that the general principle of convergence be substituted in place of the
usual limit definition of the convergence of infinite sequences. He also stressed
the importance of the concept of summability.
</p>
<p>
In 1932, four years after his first talk to the section, Orrin Frink spoke on
measure theory. He began his lecture by noting deficiencies in the definitions of
measure given by Jordan, Borel, Lebesgue, Caratheodory, and Hausdorff, then
introduced a result by von Neumann that enabled a measurable function to be
defined for all sets. During Frink’s talk he referred to Banach’s use of bounded
linear and planar sets, an indication of the section’s acquaintance with the
emerging specialty in functional analysis, but Frink never mentioned Banach’s
development of linear operators.
</p>
<p>
Columbia University’s Joseph Ritt became the section’s first invited speaker
from outside the region when he spoke at the 1929 meeting at the University of
Pennsylvania. He might have traveled by train, because the commute between
New York and Philadelphia was convenient, 30th Street Station lying within easy
walking distance of Penn’s Bennett Hall. Ritt described the work of Joseph
Liouville on the impossibility of performing certain integrations in finite terms
but the possibility of solving certain differential equations in finite terms.
</p>
<p>
The Program Committee for the 1930 meeting (Tomlinson Fort, J. R, Kline,
and John Miller) selected three speakers who presented talks on classical analysis
at the meeting held at Penn. The host institution’s James A. Shohat, whose
contributions to the Philadelphia Section will be detailed in the next chapter,
opened the meeting with a lecture on Tchebycheff polynomials. After reminding
the audience of the definition of these polynomials, he proved existence and
uniqueness theorems for orthogonal polynomials, and then he proved results
about their minimum properties and about the distribution of their roots. Penn
State’s I. M. Sheffer spoke about non-analytic functions of a complex variable,
referring on several occasions to the work of Edward Kasner. Sheffer ended the
talk by introducing matrices associated with the differentiation of non-analytic
functions. The day’s final speaker was Lehigh’s Tomlinson Fort, who had also
delivered an invited address at the section’s second meeting in 1927. In
summarizing Fort’s talk, the section’s secretary, Perry Caris, wrote briefly that
Fort <q>discussed the fundamental notions of the papers by Harald Bohr.</q> That was
no mean feat, as the famous Danish mathematician published his results in three
long papers that ran to almost 300 pages in the esteemed journal <pubtitle>Acta
Mathematica</pubtitle> in 1925 and 1926.
</p>
<p>
Recall that F. M. Weida spoke at the annual <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>-<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> meeting at Penn in
December 1926. His invited lecture to open the 1928 annual meeting of the
Philadelphia Section was on numerical analysis, the only time this topic was
addressed in the five-year period. He began the lecture by declaring, <q>The theory
of errors is a branch of mathematics which belongs to practical analysis in
applied mathematics.</q> We pause to profile Weida before analyzing other
lectures.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    <alert>Frank Mark Weida</alert> (1891-1977) was born in Allentown to Penrose John
and Sarah Rebecca (Mark) Weida. He made his biggest contributions to
EPADEL while a resident of nearby Bethlehem. After receiving a B.S.
degree from Kenyon College in 1913 he spent the following year as a
graduate student at Johns Hopkins University but dropped out to become the
head of the mathematics and science department at St. Albans School in
Knoxville, Tennessee. That was the position he held when he became one of
the charter members of the national <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in 1916. In the fall of that year he
returned to graduate school. However, after spending a year as a teaching
assistant at the University of Chicago he left without obtaining a degree.
Instead, he accepted an instructorship in mathematics at the University of
Iowa while pursuing graduate studies, culminating in a Ph.D. in 1923. One
year later he was appointed assistant professor at Montclair State College in
New Jersey, a position he held for only one year before accepting the same
position at Lehigh University. He remained at Lehigh from 1925 to 1930.
During this period he was a charter member of, and an active contributor to,
the Philadelphia Section.
</p>
<p>
F. M. Weida then took a position at George Washington University,
where he remained for the rest of his life. He served as head of the
mathematics department from 1935 until his retirement in 1957. While at
GWU he became an eminent statistician who applied the subject to
problems of interest to the military. One year after being appointed head of
the department, the 44-year old Weida married Opal Fern Dickson. The
couple had two children, Charles Rietz and Mary Elizabeth. Their son’s
middle name honors Weida’s dissertation supervisor from Iowa, the
renowned statistician H. L. Rietz. Frank Weida died on September 13, 1977,
just two weeks shy of his 86th birthday.He is buried in Christ Episcopal
Churchyard in Port Republic, Maryland.

</ul>
</p>
<p><foreign>Applied Mathematics</foreign></p>
<p>
During the five-year period under discussion the section sponsored three
lectures on standard topics from applied mathematics: astronomy, mechanics,
and potential theory. In 1928 Swarthmore’s John Miller spoke about his first
love, mathematical astronomy. He suggested a way of explaining solar coronas
by considering particles ejected from the solar surface at successive intervals. In
his lecture Miller proposed a theory based on conic sections and orthogonal
projections of planes. He concluded, <q>This theory has been applied to a great
many solar coronas that have been photographed in the past twenty years with
long focus telescopes ... Of course this does not prove that the coronas are
produced in this way but it does offer one explanation of their peculiarities.</q>
At the 1929 meeting, one year after Miller’s talk, charter member Kenneth
Lamson of Lehigh University presented an invited lecture on experiments that
led to the use of quantum theory. He described the work of the Austrian physicist
Erwin Schrödinger leading to the conclusion that energy in mechanics
corresponds to frequency in optics. Here, the Philadelphia Section was being kept
abreast of current research being conducted in Europe.
Another Lehigh faculty member, George E. Raynor, spoke about potential
theory in his 1932 talk to open the meeting at Swarthmore College. In the first
part he described recent progress on the Dirichlet problem. In the second he
supplied necessary and sufficient conditions for the Dirichlet-Neumann problem
to have a solution for a sphere with a singular point at the center.
</p>
<p><foreign>Algebra</foreign></p>
<p>
Only two invited speakers lectured on topics in algebra. One was the 1929
talk on group characters by Howard Mitchell, his second talk to the section he
helped found three years earlier. Mitchell concluded his presentation by using
group representations to prove a result of William Burnside that no group whose
order is divisible by just two different primes can be simple.
The only other lecture on algebra during this five-year period was the opening
presentation at the 1931 meeting by Penn State’s C. A. Rupp, who used notions
from linear algebra to <q>draw some geometric consequences of the linear
dependence of flat spaces in a space of n dimensions.</q>
</p>
<p><foreign>Geometry/Topology</foreign></p>
<p>
The section certainly provided the opportunity for mathematicians in the area
to keep abreast of progress in differential geometry and topology. With Princeton
housing arguably the most prominent set of topologists in the world, it is no
wonder that the section would consider the latest developments. James Alexander
delivered the first such talk at the section’s third meeting, held at Penn in 1928 in
front of a record crowd of 75 people. (That record lasted until the 1954 meeting
at Princeton, when 115 attended.) Simply titled <q>Knots,</q> his address examined
the unsolved problem of finding sufficient invariants to determine completely the
knot type of an arbitrary simple closed curve in three-dimensional space. This
topic has a modern ring to it even now.
</p>
<p>
The following year Luther Eisenhart, a graduate of Gettysburg College,
presented an invited lecture on his specialty, differential geometry. His talk was
based on a paper that had appeared in the Annals of Mathematics just one month
before.
</p>
<p>
The third Princeton faculty member to speak on topology or differential
geometry was one of the section’s charter members, Morris Knebelman, who had
been at Lehigh University when his colleague J. B. Reynolds first broached the
idea of an <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section in 1925. Knebelman’s 1931 talk in Packard Laboratory
at Lehigh came three years after he received his Princeton Ph.D. In his lecture
Knebelman extended the concept of the curvature of a surface – as studied by
Gauss, Rodrigues, and Riemann – to topological properties of a space. The
section’s secretary, Perry A. Caris, wrote, <q>it is only within the last two or three
years that the question of curvature has undergone a closer scrutiny.</q>
Knebelman’s lecture considered some of the newer results. It ended up being the
only lecture he ever delivered to the section, for shortly thereafter he moved to
Washington State University. Although he returned to Bucknell in 1964, there is
no record of any further participation in the Philadelphia Section.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Princeton trio, Penn’s J. R. Kline lectured on a topic that
straddles topology and differential geometry at the 1932 meeting at Swarthmore
College. This was the only time that Kline spoke before the Philadelphia Section.
It is not entirely unexpected that a student of R. L. Moore would subject the
foundations of a subject to a painstaking analysis. With this in mind, Kline
analyzed various definitions of a curve, noting shortcomings of earlier attempts
to define the concept. During his lecture he mentioned the work of two of his
own students, Leo Zippin and Norman Rutt. (The official report from the meeting
incorrectly lists Rutt’s surname as Ruth.) Kline ended his lecture by showing
interrelations among three types of curves: regular, perfect continuous, and those
that are the sum of a countable number of arcs.
</p>
<p>
Four of the talks given to the Philadelphia Section during 1928-1932 were
concerned with geometry, one per year except 1929. The first was delivered in
Penn’s Bennett Hall by section founder A. A. Bennett, who proposed that
triangles be studied using the theory of binary forms instead of the usual
approaches to geometry using synthetic methods, analytic geometry, projective
methods, or inversive geometry. The second invited lecture was given by Ursinus
College’s John W. Clawson, who described a polar reciprocation of a complete
quadrilateral and some of its related points and lines with respect to a circle
having the focal point (Steiner, Miquel) of the quadrilateral for center. The
following year William M. Smith of Lafayette College outlined the facilities
available for graduate study in Rome, where he had spent a sabbatical year
studying under Enrico Bompiani. Smith also reviewed contributions made by
Italian geometers to projective geometry and Riemannian geometry.
</p>
<p>
In <xref ref="Founding">Chapter</xref> we pointed out that the 1925 dissertation of Bryn Mawr’s
Marguerite Lehr dealt with algebraic geometry. Her 1931 talk at Swarthmore
College, titled <q>On curves with assigned singularities,</q> evokes a common theme.
In it Lehr presented her solution to the following problem: given a set of
nonnegative integers satisfying a plane algebraic curve defined by Plücker
equations, does a plane algebraic curve exist having these equations as its
Plücker characteristic? Given the content of Smith’s talk the year before, it was
appropriate for Lehr to make use of a theorem due to the famous Russian born,
Italian educated, geometer Oscar Zariski.
</p>
<p><foreign>Miscellaneous</foreign></p>
<p>
  The two remaining lectures delivered to the Philadelphia Section during 1928-
1932 dealt with curriculum and history/number theory. We already noted that
Arnold Dresden had been hired by Swarthmore College in 1927 to fashion that
school’s honors course in mathematics for juniors and seniors. At the 1931
meeting at Lehigh he discussed the results of his endeavor. Minutes from that
meeting record only that Dresden gave <q>an account of the way in which this plan
[for honors work] is realized, particularly in mathematics and the natural
sciences.</q> Fortunately a note from the May 1927 issue of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> supplies
more details about the program:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Students in that course are not obliged to attend classes, are free to work
at tasks assigned to them on which they have conferences with their
instructors as often as may seem desirable. No grades or records are kept
during these two years. At the end of the senior year they have to take a
comprehensive examination covering the work of these two years and
conducted both in oral and written parts by an outsider.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The honors program that Dresden designed required students to complete four
seminars in mathematics and two seminars in each of two minors. That was the
student’s whole course load during the last two years. External examiners
conducted examinations in honors. That is still the case today, although parts of
the system have been drastically revised; external examiners are still an integral
part of the program, however.
</p>
<p>
  One of the founders of the Philadelphia Section, Howard Mitchell, spoke to
the section on three separate occasions. We have already described his talks at
the organizational meeting in 1926 and the 1929 meeting at his home institution,
Penn. He also presented the very last talk in the five-year period under
discussion, <q>The life and work of Ramanujan</q>. As Perry Caris wrote in his
official report from the 1932 meeting at Swarthmore College, <q>The title ...
sufficiently indicates the nature of the paper.</q> This was not the last time our
section would be treated to a talk about the fascinating story of Ramanujan and
his phenomenal discoveries in number theory, as Nathan Fine lectured on this
same subject in 1952 based on material unavailable to Mitchell at the time. In
1990 George Andrews also spoke about Ramanujan’s mathematics at a student
conference held at Moravian College. All three Ramanujan speakers – Mitchell,
Fine, and Andrews – were associated with the University of Pennsylvania, the
first two as faculty members and the last as a doctoral student. Both Fine and
Andrews ended up at Penn State.
</p>
<p>
The discussion in the preceding paragraph raises the question, <q>Who has
delivered the most talks to the section?</q> Of those who accepted invitations to
lecture during the period of establishment, Marguerite Lehr delivered the most,
one per decade: 1931, 1944, 1954, and 1963. James Shohat comes next, having
delivered all three of his talks in one decade: 1930, 1934, and 1939. Overall,
Lehigh University’s Albert Wilansky gave the most lectures, five. In addition to
Lehr, four other mathematicians spoke to the section on four different occasions:
Cletus Oakley from Haverford College, and Hans Rademacher, Isaac
Schoenberg, and Herb Wilf from the University of Pennsylvania.

  <title>Profile: Arnold Dresden (1882-1954)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Arnold Dresden (1882-1954)</h></idx>
<p>
  Arnold Dresden was born November 23, 1882 in Amsterdam, Holland, and
began his undergraduate education at the University of Amsterdam. In 1903,
before completing his program, and against the wishes of his parents, he came to
the U. S. to help a friend who was living in Chicago, using tuition money to pay
for boat passage to New York. After landing there, he made his way to Chicago,
arriving on his 21 st birthday.
</p>
<p>
During his first two years in his adopted land, Dresden worked at various jobs,
including stacking merchandise at Marshall Field’s wholesale warehouse at $10 a
week. He also taught six classes at the high school associated with that
university, called the Laboratory School, a task he faced with grave misgivings,
not because of the long hours but because of anticipated ill behavior by the
students. He stated, <q>In Holland we tortured our teachers.</q> Yet in America he had
no trouble maintaining discipline.
</p>
<p>
By 1905 he had scraped together enough money to enroll at the University of
Chicago. He received his Ph.D. four years later with a dissertation, written under
Oskar Bolza, on the calculus of variations titled <q>The second derivatives of the
extremal integral</q>.
</p>
<p>
Upon graduation in 1909 Dresden accepted an assistant professorship at the
University of Wisconsin, where he remained until 1927. He became a naturalized
citizen four years later. Dresden felt obligated to volunteer during World War I,
so he sailed for France in September 1918 and spent one year working for the
Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
The May 1927 <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> heralded his arrival in the Philadelphia area nine
months after the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section was founded. <q>Professor Arnold Dresden of the
University of Wisconsin has been appointed professor of mathematics at
Swarthmore College. An interesting feature of his work in that college will be in
connection with the honors course for juniors and seniors.</q> Dresden described
this course in a 1931 lecture to the section. Minutes from that meeting record
only that he gave <q>an account of the way in which this plan is realized,
particularly in mathematics and the natural sciences.</q> Fortunately the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>
note supplies more details:
</p>

<p>
The honors program that Dresden designed required students to complete four

conducted all assessment in honors. That is still the case today. Although parts of
the system have been drastically revised, external examiners remain an integral
part of the program.
</p>
<p>
Arnold Dresden was one of the most respected and effective leaders in both
the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> and the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. He became actively engaged with our section as soon as
he set foot in the area. Two months after arriving at Swarthmore in September
1927, he presented an invited lecture, <q>On matrix equations</q>, reporting on a
method developed by a former Wisconsin colleague. At the same 1927 meeting
he was elected to the Program Committee; he would be elected again in 1939. He
also was elected chair for 1931-1932 and 1940-1941.
</p>
<p>
Dresden was an early, ardent supporter of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, and he became a charter
member. However, it wasn’t until his move to Swarthmore that he became active
with the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, beginning with a paper he delivered at the annual meeting in
1927. He was elected vice president for 1931 (A. A. Bennett followed him in
1933 and 1934) and president for 1933 (succeeding E. T. Bell).
</p>
<p>
Dresden began his publishing career in 1907 while a graduate student at
Chicago with two papers on the calculus of variations in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. Part of his
dissertation appeared in the Transactions the following year. [14] Further
advances would occur in papers that appeared in 1916, 1917, and 1923. In the
latter year he also published two papers on symmetric forms in n variables. But
from that time on, with only a few exceptions, all future contributions seem to
appear in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>’s Problem or Discussions-Questions Departments.
</p>
<p>
At Swarthmore, as at Wisconsin, Dresden was known as much for his musical
talent and interests as for his mathematics; his Monday evening chamber music
sessions at Swarthmore were celebrated. Swarthmore students adored him. The
alumni magazine gushed, <q>Of all the people on Swarthmore’s faculty, one of the
most beloved is a man who could easily be mistaken for Santa Claus, both in
spirit and in the flesh.</q> When asked about the history of his beard, called <q>the
finest hirsute adornment on campus</q>, he replied, <q>Why, I’ve had it ever since I
was born.</q>
</p>
<p>
Arnold Dresden resided in the town of Swarthmore from the time of his
appointment in 1927 until his death in 1954 at age 71. When he retired in 1952,
his replacement was future EPADEL governor David Rosen.

  <title>Profile: John Robert Kline (1891-1955)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Kline, John Robert (1891-1955)</h></idx>
<p>
  J. R. Kline was the most influential mathematician in the Philadelphia area
during the 1920s, and he became one of the most significant figures in the
Philadelphia Section. Indeed, his career is important in the history of
mathematics in the United States for two reasons – his relationship with the
famed topologist R. L. Moore and his support for African-American students at a
time when such encouragement was unusual.
</p>
<p>
Kline spent almost his entire life within the section’s boundaries. It seems
only fitting that his place of birth, Quakertown, lies midway between the
section’s institutional parents, Penn and Lehigh. The child of Henry K. and
Emma (Osman) Kline, he was born on December 7, 1891.
</p>
<p>
Kline obtained an A.B. in 1912 from Muhlenberg College, which granted him
an honorary doctorate in 1934. A photo of the college on the front page of the
May 30, 1934, edition of the Allentown Chronicle includes him as one of the
inset faces. Back in 1912 Kline went directly from Muhlenberg to the graduate
program at the University of Pennsylvania. The preceding year two new
instructors on the Penn faculty were EPADEL founder H. H. Mitchell and R. L.
Moore. Apparently Kline took two courses with Moore – Foundations of
Mathematics, and a sequel called Theory of Point Sets. Beyond these, individual
study was the fashion, with Moore encouraging his better students to work with
him. Kline was the best. He obtained a masters degree in 1914 and a Ph.D. two
years later. His dissertation, <q>Double elliptic geometry in terms of point and
order</q>, was published in the Annals of Mathematics in September 1916. This
makes Kline the first in a long, distinguished list of doctoral students of the
legendary Texan.
</p>
<p>
Although Moore strongly disapproved of students getting married before
completing their studies, Kline married Anna B. Shafer in June 1915 when he
was midway through his thesis. In fact, following the ceremony Moore tendered
a luncheon to the newly married couple. Anna and John Kline had one son, John
Shafer Kline.
</p>
<p>
While completing his dissertation during 1915-1916, Kline was an instructor
at his alma mater, Muhlenberg. After receiving his doctorate he returned to Penn,
winning a Harrison Fellowship for the year 1916-1917 and accepting an
instructorship for the next year. This enabled him to continue his studies with
Moore. Kline left Penn in 1918, but after one year at Yale and one at the
University of Illinois, he returned in 1920 to replace Moore, who had accepted a
professorship at Texas. Although Moore remained at Texas and Kline at Penn for
the rest of their careers, the archives at the University of Texas contain a steady
stream of letters between the two, and each sent students to study under the other,
either during their graduate studies or as post-doctorates.
</p>
<p>
The correspondence between Kline and Moore does not seem to address the
origin of the famous Moore Method of teaching. More than likely, Moore’s
techniques evolved over time, as evidenced by course descriptions in the course
catalogs at Penn and his influence on fellow faculty members (particularly
EPADEL founder H. H. Mitchell). Besides, the dissertation topics of Moore’s
Ph.D. students at Texas in the 1920s were similar to Kline’s and to Moore’s other
two Penn students, George H. Hallett, Jr. (1918) and Anna Mullikin (1922).
Knowing how Moore directed his students from basic axiomatic systems to
doctoral dissertations, it seems clear that the first person to benefit from the
Moore Method was J. R. Kline.
</p>
<p>
At Penn Kline served as chairman of the department from 1928 until the year
before his death in 1955. He also held the University’s prestigious Thomas A.
Scott Professorship from 1940. Kline took several leaves of absence during his
tenure. The first was during the year 1925-1926 as a Guggenheim Fellow at
Göttingen University, which had arguably the very best mathematics department
in the world at the time. Later he was a visiting professor at four different
institutions: Bryn Mawr College (1935-1936), Swarthmore College (1938-1939),
the University of Colorado (summer of 1949), and the University of Tübingen
(first semester of the 1952-1953 academic year). His trip to Göttingen occurred
while J. B. Reynolds was advancing the idea of forming an <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section, which
explains why Kline was not one of the founding members of the Philadelphia
Section. However, he played an active role thereafter, being elected secretary-
treasurer for 1927-1928 and chairman for 1932-1933. In addition, he attended
numerous annual meetings.
</p>
<p>
Kline contributed to the national <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in one decisive way. During World
War II the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> formed a Subcommittee on Available Teachers in College
Mathematics, with Kline one of its three members. (Another was Arnold
Dresden. The two friends resided in Swarthmore.) This subcommittee compiled
and maintained a register of vacancies and availability of mathematicians for
service throughout the war. Kline was also an important <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> officer, serving as
associate secretary 1933-1936 and as secretary 1941-1950. When he took ill in
1943, his place was taken by Arnold Dresden. (With Everett Pitcher of Lehigh
serving as secretary of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> 1967-1988, an EPADEL member held that
position for 31 of the 47 years from 1941 to 1988.) Kline also served as an
associate editor of the Transactions of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, the Bulletin of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, and the
American Journal.
</p>
<p>
During his tenure at Penn, Kline directed 19 doctoral dissertations. His first
graduate, in 1925, was longtime <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> secretary-treasurer Harry Gehman. Kline
was a particularly fair and unbiased man who, unlike his academic father, R. L.
Moore, permitted any qualified candidate to study under him. Two cases are
particularly noteworthy. In 1928 he supervised the doctoral dissertation of
Dudley W. Woodward, who became the second African-American student to
receive a Ph.D. in mathematics in the United States. William Claytor became the
third when he completed his dissertation under Kline in 1933. Recently Claytor’s
widow Mae recalled that Kline continued to support her husband even after he
received his degree, encouraging him to participate in both the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> and the
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
</p>
<p>
J. R. Kline became a respected member of the international mathematical
community, publishing four papers in the Polish journal Fundamenta
Mathematicae and three in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
Moreover, Kline wrote a joint paper with his advisor, the only publication Moore
ever coauthored. Most of Kline’s publications appeared from the time of his
dissertation in 1916 to a long paper on separation axioms in topology in 1928.
Administrative duties demanded most of his time and attention after that.
Nonetheless, he was elected secretary of the International Congress of
Mathematicians for the meeting held in 1950 in Cambridge, MA.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Kline’s life was difficult after the 1950 congress. First, his
wife Anna died that year at age 59. However, he married Eunice Story Eaton the
following year and the two of them went to Germany with much hope for a
renewed life. Kline expected to write a book on the Jordan curve theorem, its
extensions, and its applications to topology and analysis, but it never
materialized. He was beset with administrative problems upon his return to Penn.
Combined with personal tragedy and physical ailments, the torture was too much
for him to handle, and Kline committee suicide. He was buried in Quakertown
after his death on May 2, 1955.
