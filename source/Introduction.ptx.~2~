    The Mathematical Association of America (<url
    href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>) is the world’s largest
    organization devoted to the interests of collegiate mathematics,
    with a major emphasis on the teaching of mathematics at the
    collegiate level. The <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> is
    different from many professional mathematical organizations in one
    vital respect – more activity takes place within its sections than
    at its national meetings.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work chronicles the history of one of those sections during
    its first 75 years. <xref ref="Background">Chapter</xref> provides
    a background to the establishment of the section by outlining the
    formation of the two major mathematical organizations in the
    country and their sections – the
    <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and the 
    <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS (American Mathematical
    Society)</url>. <xref ref="Founding">Chapter</xref> discusses the
    founding of the Philadelphia Section in November 1926. The Section
    initially included all of central Pennsylvania and southern New
    Jersey. The next four chapters describe the development of the
    section into periods defined by external events. The first,
    1926-1933, ends with the founding of the Allegheny Section. The
    second, 1933-1941, includes the role played by émigrés who settled
    in the area after fleeing their homeland to avoid persecution. The
    period 1941-1956 begins with wartime activities and ends with the
    founding of the New Jersey Section. It is followed by a period of
    immense expansion, 1956-1978. The present name of the section,
    EPADEL, adopted in late 1978, serves as a divider for the last
    period, 1978-2000, the focus of <xref
    ref="WWII">Chapter</xref>. In addition, by the mid 1970s it became
    necessary to add a second annual meeting to the program; the final
    chapter describes the resulting spring meetings held annually
    since then.
  </p>
  <p>
    This book has been written so all chapters can be read
    independently. Thus someone who is not interested in the distant
    past, but wants to recall activities and leaders from, say, the
    sixties, can jump to the corresponding chapter with impunity. On
    the other hand, reading the book from front to back provides a
    greater appreciation for the incremental changes that have taken
    place over the <m>75</m>-year duration.
  </p>
  <p>
    The emphasis of this book, however, is not strictly on the
    mathematical developments that took place. Rather, the strength of
    the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> – and its sections –
    lies with the vast army of volunteers who march to the front line
    with plans of actions. Consequently this account emphasizes the
    people who made the section what it is. In this sense, the book
    attempts to bring the sectional leaders to life by interspersing
    biographical sketches into the narrative. Some of theses leaders
    have been so active – and decorated on a national scale – that
    larger profiles are provided at the end of chapters. Altogether 16
    personalities have been profiled; 88 others have biographical
    sketches. Appendix 1 provides an alphabetical list of all 104 of
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, finding details about these personalities has presented
    a daunting task, because few departments have kept very good
    records. However, I have been helped enormously by several
    archivists, to whom EPADEL and I owe a great debt of gratitude:
    Claire L. Andrews and John A. Erdmann (Kutztown), Raymond Butti
    (Brown), James Duffin and Ryan M. Janda (Penn), Daniel R.  Gilbert
    (Moravian), Philip A. Metzger (Lehigh), Patricia O’Donnell
    (Swarthmore), Diana F. Peterson (Haverford), Ann W. Upton
    (F&amp;M), and Carolyn Weigel (Ursinus).
  </p>
  <p>
    Many present EPADEL members have also aided me in locating
    information.  I will not attempt to list all of them here, partly
    for fear of omitting someone who spent a lot of time searching
    for, say, the exact year of retirement of a colleague.  However, I
    hereby acknowledge the invaluable help I received from a few
    people who are not sketched in this work: Stephen F. Andrilli
    (LaSalle), James P.  Crawford (Lafayette), Penelope H. Dunham
    (Muhlenberg), Gary L. Ebert (Delaware), Frederick W. Hartmann
    (Villanova), Everett Pitcher (Lehigh), Chris Rorres (Drexel),
    George M. Rosenstein, Jr. (F&amp; M), Jeff Tecosky-Feldman
    (Haverford), and Paul R. Wolfson (West Chester).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly indebted to Temple University for a Research and
    Study Leave during the spring <m>1999</m> semester. This sabbatical
    allowed me to jumpstart a history that had been languishing the
    previous two years.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I gratefully thank William Dunham (Muhlenberg), for
    his detailed proofreading of an earlier version of the entire
    manuscript, and Raymond F.  Coughlin (Temple), for his
    encouragement to publish it.

<title>Preface</title>
<p>
The <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> has played a large role
in my professional life since my undergraduate days at Pennsylvania
Military College (shortened to PMC, but now called Widener
University). Three serendipitous events formed the basis for my future
involvement in the Association during my three years there.
</p>
<p>
The first occurred while I was in the school’s library doing research
for a term paper in one of two required composition courses. Taking a
break from Occam’s Razor, I perused the stacks in the school’s small
library, which then consisted of only two rooms. Although a general
science major, I maintained a strong interest in mathematics, so my
eyes were drawn to the only magazine on mathematics in the stacks, the
<pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle>. I soon learned to call it a
<q>journal</q> instead of a <q>magazine</q>. But I found the articles
inscrutable. A year later, having scanned every issue of the journal
upon its arrival, I asked Professor Claude Helms, then head of the
department, <q>What’s topology?</q> <q>Some newfangled theory,</q> he
replied offhandedly.
</p>
<p>
But Helms encouraged me to write Harry Gehman, whose name was listed
on the cover of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. That led to the second event
that would define my career, because the longtime 
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
secretary-treasurer responded with a detailed, personal letter
explaining the path I should follow to study topology. He also invited
me to apply for membership in the <url
href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. So began my first, tentative
steps toward becoming a mathematician, though an algebraist and not a
topologist. Upon transferring to Temple University, I elected a course
with Dr. Marie Wurster, who taught me the critical ability to write
proofs.
</p>
<p>
The third decisive event took place when the Temple chair, Dr. Walter
Lawton, encouraged me to attend a sectional meeting of the 
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. So, on a nasty, wind-swept
November morning, I trudged to Haverford College to spend an entire
Saturday immersed in words and concepts that belonged on a different
planet. Yet the spirit of the speakers, especially Pincus Schub of
Penn – a little, old man with big, young ideas – was infectious.
</p>
<p>
These three events - discovering the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, joining the
<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and attending its sectional
meetings - conspired to draw me ineluctably to the present work. They
also highlighted the central role that individuals play in our
professional development. It is my grandest hope that this book
enables other sectional members to understand and to appreciate our
rich heritage. I also hope that other mathematicians will learn about
the important role this local microcosm has played in the more global
American mathematical community.
