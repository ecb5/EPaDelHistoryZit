  <title>Founding</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Background">Chapter</xref> described the founding of the first national
      organization of research mathematicians (the NYMS in 1888,
      expanded to the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> six
      years later) and the first national organization of college
      mathematics teachers, the Mathematical Association of America
      (<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>). That chapter also
      discussed the genesis of sections within a professional society
      like the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> and outlined
      the establishment of the first 16 sections of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present chapter describes the founding of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
      section initially called the Philadelphia Section, including a
      detailed account of the organizational meeting held at Lehigh
      University in November <m>1926</m>. The formation of the section
      supplies evidence of an emerging community of scholars in
      eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and southern New Jersey, one
      that boasted sufficiently many members to support and sustain
      its own <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section. To
      provide additional evidence of the emerging community the
      chapter ends with a brief description of the joint 
      <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>-
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
      national meeting held in Philadelphia just one month after the
      founding of the section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were the leaders of this new section? Where were they employed? What
      were their interests?
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall this chapter answers these questions in two ways. First,
      it describes the efforts of three mathematicians to found the
      Philadelphia Section in 1926: A.  A. Bennett and J. B. Reynolds
      from Lehigh University and H. H. Mitchell from the University of
      Pennsylvania. Each founder is profiled at the end of the
      chapter.  Their aim was to foster a spirit of collegial
      mathematics throughout eastern Pennsylvania, southern New
      Jersey, and all of Delaware. No organization can thrive with
      only three leaders, and our section benefited from a large cadre
      of volunteers. Biographical sketches of some of them are
      included, as well as brief portraits of most of the section’s
      <m>14</m> charter members. This group formed the critical mass
      needed to establish and energize the section’s early meetings.

  </introduction>

  <section>
    <title>Atlantic Apathy</title>
    <p>
      Altogether the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>
      approved <m>16</m> sections from the time of its founding in 1915
      through the formation of the Southern California Section in
      <m>1925</m>. All but one of these sections was located in the South,
      Midwest, or West. Why did Eastern states feel such little need
      for separate sections? Had not the 
      <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> originated New York? Did
      the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, whose primary
      concern was research, sufficiently address the needs of college
      teachers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaders at <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>
      headquarters answered the last question with a resounding <q>No.</q>
      Yet they expressed apprehension about the lack of interest of
      their eastern colleagues. Albert A. Bennett later recalled that
      Herbert Slaught and longtime 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> secretary W. D. Cairns
      expressed concern about the “seeming apathy or lethargy” of
      mathematicians in the Atlantic States. After all, the
      easternmost section at that time was the
      Maryland-Virginia-District of Columbia Section, which had been
      formed in <m>1916</m>. Actually, Bennett’s Lehigh colleague,
      Joseph B.  Reynolds, had suggested the idea of forming a Lehigh
      Valley Section as early as 1925, but apparently there was
      insufficient support in that small area. Just as a critical mass
      of individuals and institutions was necessary to form the
      American community of mathematicians, so the formation of an
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section in eastern
      Pennsylvania and surrounding areas would require a sufficient
      number of interested –  and qualified – individuals and
      supportive institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cairns, Slaught, and Bennett all took part in founding the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in <m>1915</m>.  
      Cairns acted as the temporary secretary of the organization
      until it took root, and then held the permanent position until
      his death in <m>1943</m>. Slaught represented the Board of
      Editors of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. Many years <m>later</m>, Bennett
      described conditions that existed at the time of the founding:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Our Association was founded under especially auspicious circumstances.
        The many favorable factors were not accidents, nor miracles, nor achieved
        through serendipity. Some were the end results of a chain of events, not
        always desired, not always with the eventual outcome in view. But in large
        part they were secured through wise planning, tactful compromise,
        cajoling of the apathetic, courageous facing of pessimists in high places,
        and unremitting work.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We will see that this quotation could apply equally to the
      Philadelphia Section if the word <q>Association</q> is replaced by
      “Section”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present EPADEL Section of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> was initially called 
      the Philadelphia Section. This name might suggest a circle as a
      model, with the city being the center of primary activity and
      radial activity emanating from it.  However, a more appropriate
      model is an ellipse because there were two focal points at the
      time of the section’s birth. One focus lay at Lehigh University,
      where the first idea and initial impetus originated with Joseph
      Reynolds and Albert Bennett. But it was soon realized that the
      Lehigh Valley alone did not provide sufficient support for an
      entire <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section. A
      greater population of college mathematics teachers was needed; a
      critical mass was necessary. It was Philadelphia, the second
      focus located some <m>40</m> miles south of Lehigh, that supplied the
      bulk of scholars interested primarily in mathematics at the
      college level.

  <section>
    <title>The First Community</title>
    <p>
      We proceed to describe the small but active community of
      mathematicians in Eastern Pennsylvania during the year of the
      section’s founding in <m>1926</m> by examining articles and
      reports from the ten issues of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> appearing
      that year. <m>This</m> group would overcome <q>Atlantic apathy</q> to
      form the first Eastern section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The January issue begins with the official report of the ninth
      annual summer meeting of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> held the previous 
      September at Cornell University. Of national interest was the
      formal adoption of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/member-communities/maa-awards/writing-awards/chauvenet-prizes"> 
        Chauvenet Prize
      </url> 
      for mathematical exposition, the first award given by the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. The three-person committee
      charged with selecting the winner of this coveted prize included
      Bryn Mawr College’s Anna Pell Wheeler, who would present the AMS
      Colloquium Lecture at the <m>1927</m> summer meeting. As we will
      see, Wheeler became the first woman ever to head our section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same issue of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> reveals that of the
      <m>160</m> mathematicians who attended the Association’s
      national meeting in Kansas City the previous year, only
      J. R. Kline of the University of Pennsylvania and Harold
      S. Everett of Penn State came from eastern or central
      Pennsylvania. However, another attendee, Arnold Dresden, would
      move from the University of Wisconsin to Swarthmore College the
      next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The February <m>1926</m> issue reveals that five of the
      <m>61</m> new <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members
      hailed from the Philadelphia area. Not only does this quintet
      reflect a growing community, but also the scattered locations of
      their institutions, different levels of their teaching, and wide
      range of mathematical interests, suggest a diverse local
      populace. Three of the new members taught at colleges in the
      Lehigh Valley: Laura F. McDonough (Moravian College),
      W. B. Marquard (Lafayette College), and Morris S. Knebelman
      (Lehigh University). Although Knebelman was an active
      participant in sectional activities, there is no record of
      McDonough or Marquard ever attending one of the section’s annual
      meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <alert>Laura F. McDonough</alert> was appointed the head of
          the mathematics department at the Moravian College for Women
          in <m>1925</m>. She had apparently joined the department a
          year earlier at a miserly <q>$<m>75</m> a month and
          house</q> (which probably meant a room in a
          dormitory). McDonough held a B.A.  from Penn and pursued
          graduate studies there. Moravian catalogues list her as a
          faculty member up to <m>1930</m>; we assume that she moved after
          that.
        </li>
        <li> <alert>William B. Marquard</alert> received an
        E. M. degree from Ohio State. He came to Lafayette College in
        1907 as an instructor in mining engineering.  Although he was
        promoted to assistant professor five years later, in 1920 he
        moved to the Department of Mechanics as an associate
        professor. He was promoted to professor of applied mechanics
        in 1929 and retired as emeritus professor in <m>1943</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two other new <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>
      members were Nora Kieffer, then at the Normal School but later
      at Cumberland Valley State Teachers College in Shippensburg, and
      V. Z. Shippy, from the select Central High School in
      Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second measure of activity within the section is graduate
      education. Of the <m>27</m> Ph.D. degrees in mathematics granted
      by American universities in <m>1925</m>, universities in eastern
      Pennsylvania awarded four. The University of Pennsylvania
      awarded three: to longtime 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> secretary Harry Gehman, 
      to Perry Aquila Caris, and to Robert William Hartley. No
      supervisor is listed for Caris’s dissertation, but our section
      founder Howard Mitchell supervised Hartley’s dissertation while
      section leader J. R. Kline supervised Gehman’s. The remaining
      Ph.D. degree was awarded to Anna M. Lehr at Bryn Mawr
      College. Although Marguerite Lehr officially received her degree
      from the physics department, the title of her dissertation
      indicates a purely mathematical topic: <q>The plane quintic with
      five cusps</q>. Besides, she was one of seven women whose doctoral
      studies were supervised by the renowned Charlotte Angas Scott,
      who taught at Bryn Mawr from <m>1885</m> to <m>1925</m>. Scott herself
      received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1885, although
      she had actually carried out her studies at Cambridge
      University, which did not grant degrees to women at the
      time. Profiles of Caris and Lehr will appear in chapters devoted
      to the periods in which they served as chairs of the section –
      Caris in <m>1945</m> and <m>1950</m>, and Lehr in <m>1958</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general we will adhere to the following convention.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>
          A profile of each chair of the section will appear in the
          chapter that covers the year in which the chairman’s term
          occurred.
        </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A third measure of growth in the local community is the increase in the size of
      faculties, which was carried out in the face of severe economic conditions.
      Lehigh hired K. W. Lamson and the famous calculus textbook author L. L.
      Smail. Other new faculty members in the area included James E. Davis at Drexel
      and Echo D. Pepper at Bryn Mawr. According to our convention, profiles of
      Smail and Davis will appear subsequently. For now we provide biographical
      sketches of Pepper and Lamson.
    </p>
<p> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Echo Dolores Pepper</alert> (<m>1897-1979</m>) was born,
        raised, and mostly educated in the Pacific Northwest. We do
        not know the origin of her most unusual first name. Hailing
        from Spokane, Washington, Echo Pepper received her B.S. degree
        in 1920 and her M.S. two years later from the University of
        Washington in Seattle. She entered the graduate program at the
        University of Chicago in <m>1923</m> and obtained her Ph.D. two years
        later under the eminent algebraist Leonard Dickson. After
        spending a year at Oxford University on a National Research
        Council fellowship, Pepper accepted an instructorship in
        mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, a position she held for only
        two years.  Even though she attended national
        <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>-
        <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
        meetings, she never joined either of these organizations,
        preferring the AAAS instead. In <m>1928</m> Pepper moved to the
        University of Illinois, where she stayed until becoming the
        department head at Notre Dame University in <m>1965</m>. She retired
        from that position in <m>1970</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Kenneth Worcester Lamson</alert> was born in Vermont in
        <m>1885</m>. He obtained an A.B. from Harvard in <m>1906</m>
        at age <m>21</m>. Lamson played the string bass in
        college. When he was playing gigs with a band, he would put
        his physics books on the music stand and study while plucking
        away subconsciously at the instrument. Five years later he was
        appointed an instructor at South Dakota College (now the
        University of South Dakota). He then enrolled at the
        University of Chicago, where he was situated when he became a
        charter member of the 
        <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in <m>1915</m>. He obtained his
        Ph.D. in <m>1917</m> under Gilbert Bliss for a dissertation on the
        calculus of variations, which was published in the American
        Journal of Mathematics three years later. Upon graduation
        Lamson accepted an assistant professorship at Columbia
        University, where he remained through the summer of <m>1926</m>. He
        then moved to Lehigh University, which brought him to the area
        the same fall that the Philadelphia Section was founded. Three
        years later he presented an invited lecture at the section’s
        annual meeting. Lamson spent the rest of his career at Lehigh,
        retiring in <m>1951</m> as emeritus associate professor. He then
        taught in Puerto Rico for three years before returning to
        teach part-time at Lehigh.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      The <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> for <m>1926</m> also records vigorous
      activity by undergraduate students in the area. During its
      summer term the University of Pennsylvania not only offered
      standard courses in solid geometry, trigonometry, college
      algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus, but there was
      sufficient demand to run three advanced undergraduate courses:
      elementary statistics with J. D. Eshelman, advanced calculus
      with G. H. Hallett, and the theory of invariants with O. E.
      Glenn. Hallett and Glenn had received their doctorates from the
      University of Pennsylvania. George Hervay Hallett was awarded
      his degree in 1896 for a dissertation on linear differential
      equations. He directed the 1905 dissertation of
      O. E. Glenn. Hallett’s son, George H. Hallett, Jr., wrote a
      dissertation in <m>1918</m> under the renowned R. L. Moore at
      Penn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to summer courses offered at the University of
      Pennsylvania in <m>1926</m>, the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> reported on
      activities offered by its Pi Mu Epsilon Chapter.  There were
      also reports submitted on activities sponsored by The Ibis Club
      at the Women’s College of Delaware in Newark, and the Math Club
      of the New Jersey College for Women.
    </p>
    <p>
      A traditional measure of faculty activity is publication, and
      here too the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> reflects increased bustle in
      eastern Pennsylvania. Albert Bennett published a note in the
      November issue on <q>New properties on an orthocentric system of
      triangles</q>. The same issue contains a paper by his Lehigh
      colleague Frank Mark Weida, titled <q>On the correlation between
      two functions</q>. The paper was based on a lecture that Weida had
      presented at the annual 
      <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting on New Year’s Day,
      1926.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>The Philadelphia Story</title>
    <p>
      What’s in a name? Apparently, lots. The name Philadelphia
      Section marked the first time that a section was named after a
      city instead of a state (or a union of states or a proper subset
      of a state). The name itself was certainly controversial.  In
      the late <m>1960</m>s Albert Bennett reminisced about events
      surrounding that designation.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        At the organizational meeting ... a request for establishing
        the Philadelphia Section of the 
        <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> was forwarded to
        Secretary Cairns. His first reaction was that the name was
        ill-chosen, since all the other Sections were named for
        States, and to name a section after so small a political unit
        as a city, would break sound precedent. I wrote back that
        Pennsylvania had two natural cultural centers, one at the
        extreme east (Philadelphia), the other at the extreme west
        (Pittsburgh). One could not expect much of an attendance at
        either of these places, from residents near the other.
        Philadelphia should attract persons from Eastern Pennsylvania,
        Delaware and southern New Jersey. Setting a new precedent
        might encourage the later founding of a Pittsburgh Section,
        attracting mathematical instructors from West Virginia and
        Eastern Ohio as well as from western Pennsylvania. Cairns and
        Slaught were not obstinate, and in December, the Section was
        admitted under its proposed name, subject of course to the
        usual provision of By-Laws, etc., and promises of good
        behavior.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Bennett was certainly right on target about attendance from
      mathematicians located in Delaware and southern New
      Jersey. Delaware has remained an integral part of the section
      since its founding. However, a New Jersey Section was created in
      <m>1956</m>, and although most residents from the southern part
      of the Garden State have participated in its activities since
      its inception, several continue to attend the Philadelphia
      Section’s programs. As we shall see, mathematicians from
      Princeton and Rutgers were especially active in the Philadelphia
      Section in the <m>30</m>-year period from the founding of the
      section in <m>1926</m> to the founding of the New Jersey
      Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bennett was accurate about attendance in the eastern part of
      Pennsylvania, his comments about the western part were uncannily
      prescient. The Allegheny Mountain Section became the <m>19th</m> 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section in <m>1933</m>. (The
      Wisconsin Section was created one year earlier.) As Bennett
      predicted, the Allegheny Mountain Section attracted
      mathematically oriented residents of West Virginia and eastern
      Ohio as well as western Pennsylvania. It should be mentioned,
      however, that the formation of the second section in
      Pennsylvania caused the Philadelphia Section to lose its
      colleagues from Penn State, who became affiliated with the
      Allegheny Mountain Section. As with some New Jersey
      mathematicians, a cadre of members from central Pennsylvania
      participated actively in the Philadelphia Section until the new
      section was formed, and a few of them continued their
      involvement after that.

  <section>
    <title>Organizational Meeting</title>
    <p>
      The minutes from the meeting of the Board of Trustees (now
      Governors) that was held during the annual <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> meeting on December
      <m>30-31</m>, <m>1926</m>, provide a summary of proceedings that
      took place during the latter part of <m>1926</m>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
      The Trustees voted to approve the organization of a PHILADELPHIA
      SECTION of the Association, subject to the submission of suitable by-laws,
      a petition to that effect having been sent by a meeting of thirteen members
      of the Association. This section is intended to serve more than one hundred
      members living in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, in southern New
      Jersey, and in Delaware, meetings usually being held in Philadelphia.
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      We do not know if the petition sent to <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> headquarters, then located
      in Columbus, Ohio, is extant, so the identity of the <m>13</m>
      members who signed it cannot be known with certainty. However,
      the official report from the most important event in the
      section’s history, the organizational meeting held on Saturday,
      November <m>27</m>, <m>1926</m>, just two days after Thanksgiving,
      contains details of the proceedings and so provides clues to the
      identity of the signatories. On that date Howard H. Mitchell of
      the University of Pennsylvania, and Albert A.  Bennett and
      Joseph B. Reynolds of Lehigh University, arranged a program of
      talks appropriate for college mathematics teachers at Lehigh. In
      so doing, these three mathematicians became the founding members
      of the section. Their profiles are given at the end of the
      chapter and their continued participation in sectional
      activities is chronicled in subsequent chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of the section today will recognize the format from the
      <m>1926</m> meeting, except for the fact that it was held on the
      Saturday following Thanksgiving, a tradition that was continued
      until <m>1963</m>. (Recall from <xref ref="Background">Chapter</xref> that the 
      <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> held its organizational
      meeting on Thanksgiving Day <m>75</m> years earlier.) The
      initial gathering featured five lectures about mathematics and
      the teaching of mathematics. It was followed by a break for
      lunch and a business meeting. In <m>1926</m> lunch preceded the
      business meeting, the reverse of today’s order. Besides, the
      spouses of the local members were present during lunch. But on
      this historic date, November <m>27</m>, <m>1926</m>, there was
      vital business to conduct, and it was important for the three
      founders to discuss their major initiative over lunch before
      proceeding with business. Once the meal was finished, a vote was
      taken. It was agreed unanimously to request permission of the
      Trustees of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> for
      the organization of a new section to be known as the
      Philadelphia Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the proposed section still had to be approved by the
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, the <m>20</m> persons
      in attendance moved to set up a governing structure for future
      meetings.  They decided initially to elect two officials to
      one-year terms. The results of the election reinforce our
      elliptical model, with officers coming from the two foci,
      chairman Howard Mitchell from Penn and vice-chairman and
      secretary-treasurer Albert Bennett from Lehigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed two other items of business. The first was a vote
      to approve the section’s by-laws. Although the gathering
      deferred official adoption of the by-laws until the next meeting
      the following November in Philadelphia, minutes from the 1927
      meeting do not mention the by-laws at all. It is safe to assume
      they were approved without dissent. The second item of business
      in 1926 was an expression of appreciation by everyone in
      attendance for the courtesies extended by Lehigh
      University. Then the session adjourned. Unlike today, no
      mathematics followed lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detailed information about the five lectures will be presented
      in the next chapter. Here we note that, appropriately enough,
      the founder Joseph Reynolds of Lehigh presented the first
      lecture, on evolutes of certain plane curves. The next three
      talks were also on mathematical topics: Howard Mitchell of Penn
      spoke on ideals of quadratic forms, Lloyd Smail of Lehigh
      described Dedekind’s theory of irrationals, and William M. Smith
      of Lafayette discussed differential equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 20 persons who were able to commute to Bethlehem for the meeting
      included 14 members of the 
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, 
      six of whom were on the faculty at Lehigh.  These <m>14</m> therefore
      became the <alert>charter members of the section</alert>

      Six of the <m>14</m> charter members were eventually elected

      (Bennett, Mitchell, Reynolds, Smail, Smith, and Wilson). We
      glimpsed Lamson above. Among the others, Knedler and Weida
      participated actively enough to warrant biographical sketches at
      their times of maximal service. Here we sketch four of the
      remaining five charter members.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Rollin Landis Charles</alert> (1885-1941), a
        mathematical physicist born in Bethlehem, PA, was associated
        with three institutions in the Philadelphia Section. He
        obtained two degrees at Lehigh University – an A.B. in 1907
        and an A.M. in <m>1910</m>. He pursued additional courses at
        Lehigh, Columbia, and Penn. Charles began teaching at Lehigh
        as an instructor in physics in the fall after taking his
        undergraduate degree, the position he held when he became a
        charter member of the 
        <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> 
        in <m>1916</m>. In <m>1922</m> he moved to Franklin &amp;
        Marshall College as professor of physics and applied
        electricity, the position he held at the time of the founding
        of the Philadelphia Section.  Charles remained at F &amp; M
        until his death at age <m>56</m>. In the meantime he was also a
        professor at Albright College in Reading, PA, from <m>1928</m> to
        <m>1930</m>. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the
        Advancement of Science.  He was also a member of several other
        organizations, including the American Philatelic Society, Sons
        of the Revolution, and the Pennsylvania German Society.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Victor H. Doushkess</alert> (1895-1966) received a B. S. degree at Lehigh
        University in 1917. He enrolled in the graduate program at Lafayette
        College two years later, receiving an A. M. degree in 1921. Doushkess was
        appointed an instructor at Lafayette in 1919 and was promoted to assistant
        professor five years later. He remained at Lafayette until 1935.
      </li>
      <li> <alert>Morris Samuel Knebelman</alert> (<m>1890-1972</m>)
      was born in Russia. After coming to the U.S., he received a
      B.S. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1912 and an
      M.S. from Lehigh University in <m>1914</m>. During his second
      year at Lehigh he was appointed an instructor. In <m>1925</m> he
      enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton University, where
      he earned his Ph.D. in <m>1928</m> for a dissertation on
      differential geometry written under two notable advisors, Oswald
      Veblen and Luther Eisenhart. Knebelman served as an instructor
      at Princeton while completing his degree, and he remained there
      the next year on a National Research Council Fellowship. Due to
      the sudden death of a faculty member in the summer of
      <m>1929</m>, Princeton had the dire need for someone to head the
      university’s mathematics courses for engineers. Knebelman’s
      background at Lehigh made him a suitable candidate, so he was
      offered the position of assistant professor. He continued in
      this capacity until 1939, when he became a professor and head of
      the department at Washington State University. He later became
      Dean of the Graduate School at Washington. Knebelman taught
      there until <m>1965</m> when, at age <m>74</m>, he returned east
      as a visiting professor at Bucknell University. He died in
      Lewisburg in <m>1972</m> at age <m>82</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>William Franklin Long</alert> (<m>1871-1945</m>) was an
        astronomer who was born in Boyertown, PA. He graduated from
        Kutztown State Normal School in <m>1891</m>, earned his bachelors
        degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in <m>1897</m>, and did
        graduate work at Cornell, Harvard, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and
        Columbia.  In <m>1942</m> F&amp;M bestowed on him an honorary degree
        of Doctor of Science.  Long taught in high schools in
        Johnstown and Pittsburgh from the time of his graduation from
        F&amp;M until <m>1918</m>. He was also a principal during that
        time. In <m>1918</m>, Long accepted a professorship of astronomy and
        mathematics at his alma mater, and remained there for the next
        <m>26</m> years. A newspaper clipping states, <q>he was known by
        <sq>thousands of Lancastrians</sq> as the director of the Scholl
        Observatory.</q> Long retired in June <m>1944</m>, yet he taught an
        evening astronomy course in the fall of <m>1944</m>. He died on New
        Year’s Day <m>1945</m> at age <m>73</m>.

</p>
    <p>
      Although we were unable to locate personal items about the
      remaining charter member, some of the professional activities of
      <alert>John Albert Foberg</alert> are worth noting because they
      link the section to current developments in mathematics
      education. J. A. Foberg graduated from the University of
      Illinois and taught at Crane Junior College in Chicago when he
      became a charter member of the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> upon its founding in
      1915. One year later he was selected to be the representative
      from the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers
      to the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements. This
      committee was formed by the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> <q>to give national
      expression to the movement for reform in the teaching of
      mathematics in secondary schools and colleges.</q> Foberg and J. W.
      Young (Dartmouth) received funds to devote the entire year
      1919-1920 to writing reports for the committee. Foberg’s report,
      <q>Junior High School Mathematics</q>, appeared at the end of the
      year. Three years earlier he had been one of the organizers of
      the Illinois Section of the <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. A 1972 <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> publication reported, <q>It
      is worth noting, in this day of expansion of the junior college
      concept, that the first chairman of the Section was J. A. Foberg
      of Crane Junior College.</q> When the NCTM was founded in the early
      part of 1920 Foberg was elected its first
      secretary-treasurer. He also became the business manager for the
      NCTM’s official journal, The Mathematics Teacher. During this
      time he moved to Pennsylvania to become the State Director of
      Science and Mathematics, the position he held when the
      Philadelphia Section was founded in 1926. The preceding year he
      published the book General High School Mathematics with
      D. E. Smith and W. D. Reeve from Columbia Teachers
      College. Foberg later completed his Ph.D. at the University of
      Pittsburgh. He then left the Department of Public Instruction to
      become the head of the mathematics department at California
      State College. He appears to have lived in Camp Hill during his
      entire stay in the state. He was last listed in <url
      href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> membership rolls for the
      academic year 1937-1938.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brief glimpse of those <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members who attended the organizational
      meeting shows a solid core of mathematicians with a wide array of interests and
      abilities. Most of the 14 <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members were associated with colleges and
      universities in the area, and most were involved with undergraduate programs
      entirely. Not all were pure mathematicians, however, as the initial meeting
      attracted a mathematical physicist and a mathematical astronomer.

  <section>
    <title>Annual Meeting</title>
    <p>
      The year 1926 was a heady time for mathematicians in the Philadelphia area.
      First came the organizational meeting at Lehigh to form the Philadelphia Section
      on November 27. Just one month later the University of Pennsylvania hosted the
      four-day annual <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting from December 28 right on up to New Year’s Eve
      on December 31. The <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting was held in conjunction with Section A of
      the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This marked the first
      time such a meeting was held in the region. But of even more relevance for this
      account, the meeting marked one of the first times that the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> met in
      conjunction with the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, as the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> held its 11 th annual meeting over the last
      two days of the conference. We discuss this joint meeting briefly because it
      provides additional evidence of the broad mathematical community that had
      coalesced in the Philadelphia area by the end of 1926.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joint meeting was a roaring success. For one thing, a record 264 people
      attended, of whom 187 belonged to the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. (For comparison sake, attendance
      at the joint meetings held in January 2000 numbered over 4200.) This was in
      striking contrast to the previous meeting in Kansas City, whose attendance of 122
      members had been disappointing. We have examined the attendance roll from the
      meeting to obtain a profile of some of the most active mathematicians from the
      EPADEL area.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that the host institution, Penn, would supply the most
      attendees, 10 in all. From this group, P. A. Caris and H. H. Mitchell are profiled
      as section officers and E. S. Crawley will be introduced in the next chapter. The
      others who attended were Virgil William Adkisson, William Leake Ayres, Joel
      D. Eshleman, Henry Brown Evans, Oliver Edmunds Glenn, Harold Marshall
      Lufkin, and Frederick Hollister Safford. Four other <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members from
      Philadelphia attended the annual meeting: one college teacher (James E. Davis
      from Drexel, who would become chair of the section in 1942) plus three high-
      school teachers (J. A. Clarke from West Philadelphia High School for Boys, V.
      Z. Shippy from Central High School, and W. Sensenig, who was listed only as
      <q>High School</q>).
    </p>
<p>
    <ul> 
      <li> <alert>Wayne Sensenig</alert> was born in Goodville, PA, in 1879, and received his
      bachelors degree from Haverford College in 1901. We suspect that his father
      was David M. Sensenig, who taught at West Chester at the turn of the
      century. Wayne Sensenig was employed as an engineer until becoming a
      high school mathematics teacher in Philadelphia in 1912. While teaching by
      day he attended classes at the University of Pennsylvania by night, resulting
      in an A. M. degree in just two years. In 1919 he received his Ph.D. under
      Oliver E. Glenn. His doctoral dissertation, <q>Concerning the invariant theory
      of involutions of conics</q>, was published in the American Journal of
      Mathematics in 1919. He also published a note on definite integrals in the
      <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> the following year. Having no evidence to the contrary, we assume
      that Sensenig taught in high school the rest of his life. A charter member of
      the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in 1915, he was last listed on the membership roll for the
      academic year 1933-1934, when he lived in Bala Cynwyd.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      Five faculty members from four different colleges in the Philadelphia suburbs
      also attended the joint <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>-<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> meeting. The most famous was Anna Pell
      Wheeler of Bryn Mawr College. Others included L. W. Reid and Albert H.
      Wilson from Haverford College, John W. Clawson from Ursinus College, and
      John H. Pitman from Swarthmore College. All but Reid will be introduced in due
      course.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li> <alert>Legh Wilber Reid</alert> (1867-1961) was born in Alexandria, Virginia. He
      obtained one bachelors degree from VMI in 1887 and another from Johns
      Hopkins University two years later. He then worked for the U. S. Bureau of
      the Census and the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, where his job title was
      listed as <q>computer</q>. Reid was appointed an instructor at Princeton University in 1893 while he began taking graduate courses. He obtained a
      masters degree from Princeton in 1896, after which he sailed abroad to study
      in Göttingen, obtaining his doctorate under the renowned David Hilbert in
      1899. Reid spent the rest of his career at Haverford College, from his
      appointment in 1900 to his retirement in 1934. Known affectionately to
      Haverford students as <q><m>f</m> of <m>x</m></q>, he was one of the founders of the College’s
      chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and served as its secretary for 40 years. His book
      The Theory of Algebraic Numbers was used as a graduate text in American
      colleges for over 50 years from the time it was published in 1910; David
      Hilbert wrote a brief introduction. Reid died in 1961 at age 93.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      Six <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> members from the Lehigh Valley traveled to Philadelphia for the
      meeting, including four from Lehigh University: Albert Bennett, Joseph
      Reynolds, Lloyd Smail, and Frank Weida. The other two were Albert G. Rau of
      Moravian College and William M. Smith of Lafayette College. All six men
      played active roles in the Philadelphia Section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the two focal points, various other locations within the
      Philadelphia Section were strongly represented at the joint meeting. Seven
      faculty members from the Pennsylvania State College [now University] attended,
      including the married couple Frederick W. and Helen B. Owens. Frederick’s
      affiliation is listed academically (Pennsylvania State College), whereas Helen’s is
      listed geographically (State College). Both participated actively in events
      sponsored by the Philadelphia Section even beyond the formation of a section in
      western Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      We already mentioned four faculty members from Princeton who attended the
      meeting. Added to that list is charter member Morris Knebelman, who had just
      moved across the Delaware River that year from Lehigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four faculty members from Rutgers also attended, including two who were
      active in the Philadelphia Section: Albert E. Meder and Richard Morris. The
      latter was especially vigorous in our section; we will meet him again in <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref>. Thirty years later Meder was the driving force behind the establishment of the
      New Jersey Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four other members who lived within the Philadelphia Section’s boundaries
      are also worthy of mention. W. F. Long of Franklin &amp; Marshall College traveled
      from Lancaster, H. S. Everett from Penn State, C. J. Rees from the University of
      Delaware in Newark, and Ruth Thompson from the New Jersey College for
      Women at Rutgers. Neither Long nor Everett participated in many sectional
      activities, but Rees was elected chair in 1946 and Thompson organized the
      section’s annual meeting in 1934. We have been unable to find any biographical
      information on Ruth Thompson. William F. Long and Carl J. Rees will be
      introduced later, but for now we supply information on H. S. Everett.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Harry Scheidy Everett</alert> was born in Scheidys, PA. He taught
        in high school from the time of his graduation in 1908 until 1915. In the
        meantime he attended classes at Bucknell, where he obtained three degrees in consecutive years – A.B. 1912, A.M. 1913, Sc.M. 1914. He accepted an
        instructorship at Bucknell in 1915. H. S. Everett spent the year 1921-1922
        on a fellowship at the University of Chicago, resulting in his Ph.D. at the
        end of the year. His dissertation topic involved homogeneous polynomials
        expressible in terms of determinants whose elements were such
        polynomials. Upon returning to Bucknell he was promoted to professor of
        applied mathematics and astronomy. However, in 1927 he returned to
        Chicago, where he held several positions over the next 29 years – professor
        of extension courses, professor of home study, dean, and lecturer in the
        Adler Planetarium. From 1926 to 1933 he served as an associate editor of
        the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. Upon retirement in 1956 as Extension Professor Emeritus,
        Everett accepted a visiting professorship at Penn State. Five years later he
        returned to academia full time when he accepted a professorship at East
        Stroudsburg. Everett moved to West Chester in 1973, and he died there four
        years later at age 86.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      Recall that the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> part of the meeting was held on the final two days of the
      joint meeting, December 30 and 31. The major part of the scientific program
      consisted of eight papers presented at two separate sessions. Two of the eight
      speakers were from the Philadelphia Section. The title of the talk by Lehigh’s F.
      M. Weida was <q>On various conceptions of correlation,</q> and the title of the talk
      by Swarthmore’s J. H. Pitman was <q>Modern methods and results of stellar
      parallax investigations</q>. Weida is profiled in the next chapter.
    </p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>John Himes Pitman</alert> (1890-1952) was born in Conshohocken, PA. He was
        awarded two degrees from Swarthmore College, an A.B. in 1910 and an
        M.A. in 1911. He remained at Swarthmore an additional year as a Lippincott
        Fellow, and then he crossed the country to become a Lick Observatory
        Fellow in California. In 1913 Pitman rejoined the Swarthmore community
        as an instructor in the department of mathematics and astronomy, and
        remained there the rest of his life. A mathematical astronomer who
        specialized in stellar parallaxes, masses of binary stars, and orbits and
        asteroids, he was elected president of the Rittenhouse Astronomical Society.
        Active politically, Pitman served as a burgess for the town of Swarthmore
        from 1933 to 1947 and as chairman of the county Democratic Committee.
        Poor health forced him to resign his professorial and political positions in
        1947.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      One notable aspect of Pitman’s talk was his use of an emerging technology to
      illustrate the lecture. Rather than merely reading his paper, as was customary at
      the time, he used lanternslides to display photos of stars whose distances he had
      measured. Other speakers used lanternslides as well. Although there is no
      indication when speakers began using this new technology at annual meetings,
      lanternslides eventually gave way to overhead projectors, which are currently giving way to computer-generated presentations. There is no record of the first
      use of either overhead projectors or computers at the section’s annual meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the joint meeting an <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>-<url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> dinner was held at the Aldine
      Hotel (since demolished). Following dessert came four talks of a rather light
      nature, the first three by Herbert Slaught, George D. Birkhoff, and G. D. Olds.
      According to the official minutes from the meeting the fourth speaker, Anna Pell
      Wheeler, <q>spoke appropriately on behalf of the ladies</q>. No amplification of this
      quotation was provided. Such a dinner is a regular affair at today’s national
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> meetings. Today some sectional meetings hold dinners, but the
      Philadelphia Section has held few, mainly because of the one-day duration of its
      meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the joint session a resolution was adopted by the combined
      body of mathematicians to express their <q>grateful appreciation of the gracious
      hospitality extended them by the University of Pennsylvania, the American
      Philosophical Society, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Drexel Institute
      [now Drexel University], and the Franklin Institute.</q> The participation of the
      three non-academic institutions reflects the close relationship that existed in the
      1920s between mathematics and the natural sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We end this chapter with three related facts about the Penn meetings. This
      was not the first annual <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting that the University of Pennsylvania hosted,
      for the University had played host to the annual summer meeting in 1912, though
      it was the first <q>Christmas meeting</q>. Although only 29 people attended the
      meeting in 1912, 26 of them delivered papers. Second, Lehigh University hosted
      the annual <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting held December 26-28, 1929, three years after the
      historic Penn meeting, but it was not a joint affair with the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. Third, there
      were two hosts for the 1932 meeting, Princeton University and Atlantic City,
      both of which were part of the Philadelphia Section at the time. By the time an
      annual meeting was held in Atlantic City again, in 1971, that resort town was part
      of the New Jersey Section.

      Profile: Albert Arnold Bennett (1888-1971)
</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Albert Arnold Bennett (1888-1971)</h></idx>
    
    <p>A. A. Bennett must have been one of the most colorful personalities in the
    history of EPADEL, and the author wishes he had known him. Although Bennett
    lived in our area on two separate occasions totaling only eight years he made
    notable contributions to the Philadelphia Section, the most important being its
    founding in 1926.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert Arnold Bennett was born on June 2, 1888, in Yokohama, Japan. His
      parents, Albert Arnold and Mela Isabelle (Barrows), were missionaries in Japan
      at the time. The younger Albert Bennett returned to Providence in 1902 to live
      with relatives so he could complete his high-school education and prepare for
      college. He excelled in school, earning two degrees from Brown University, an
      A.B. in 1910 and an Sc. M. in 1911 (based primarily on a thesis he had written
      the preceding year).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett entered the graduate program in mathematics at Princeton University
      in 1910. Just a few months earlier Howard Mitchell, one of the other two
      founders of the Philadelphia Section, received his Ph.D. from Princeton and was
      in transit to a position at Yale, so it appears that the two future founders of
      EPADEL missed each other on the first part of Bennett’s initial residence in the
      Philadelphia area. Bennett earned his second masters degree, an A.M., at
      Princeton the following year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett completed his doctoral dissertation in 1915 at Princeton under
      Oswald Veblen, who had been Howard Mitchell’s dissertation supervisor as well.
      (If Bennett and Mitchell are called the fathers of EPADEL, then Veblen must be
      the Section’s grandfather.) Later in life Bennett undertook advanced training in
      mathematics at the University of Chicago and at three of the most prestigious
      centers in Europe: Paris, Göttingen, and Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dealing with algebra and projective geometry, Bennett’s dissertation appeared
      in the prestigious Annals of Mathematics the same year as his degree under the
      title, <q>An algebraic treatment of the theorem of closure</q>. While only 21 pages
      long, it accounted for over 10% of the 196 pages in that volume of the journal for
      the years 1914-1915. Moreover, he published a paper in three of the four issues
      of the next volume, all on topics in analysis. Overall his three papers and one
      note in the volume for 1916-1917 account for 47 of the 217 pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly Bennett’s star was rising. He had begun his professional career by
      remaining at Princeton as an instructor from 1914 to 1916. However, he left the
      east in the fall of 1916 to accept a position as adjunct professor at the University
      of Texas at Austin, where he remained for nine years. Although 26 years old
      when he moved to Texas, patriotism compelled him to enroll in the country’s
      first Officer’s Training College. As a result he was sent to Leon Springs, Texas,
      and later to Fort Monroe, Virginia. On August 15, 1917, he was commissioned as
      a Captain in C.A.R.C. but it appears that throughout World War I he remained
      stationed in the States. The following June, Bennett was transferred to the
      Ordnance Corps, where he served in Oswald Veblen’s ballistics research staff at
      Aberdeen Proving Ground with Gilbert Bliss and Norbert Wiener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett was honorably discharged on January 15, 1919. Nonetheless, while
      continuing to teach at the University of Texas, he served as a civilian
      <q>mathematician and dynamics expert</q> with the Ordnance Corps from June 1919
      to September 1921. During this time he wrote two books based on his
      experiences, Introduction to Ballistics in 1921 and Tables for Interior Ballistics
      in 1922.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time Bennett spent in World War I undoubtedly accounts for the three-
      year gap in his publication record between 1917 and 1920. However, like many
      mathematicians caught up in war, Bennett did not let combat duty entirely
      interfere with his studies. The author of the 1918 paper is listed as Captain Albert
      A. Bennett, C.A.R.C. To emphasize his position, and the isolation of his outpost,
      the concluding paragraph of the paper reads, <q>This treatment is believed to be
      original, but the literature available for examination by the author is that
      customary to an army post, ‘somewhere on the Gulf of Mexico,’ - nil.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1921, his war duties completed, Bennett was ready to resume a professional
      career, and Texas rewarded him with a promotion to associate professor. The
      renowned topologist and educator R. L. Moore had moved from Penn to Texas
      the previous year. While in Texas, Bennett met Velma McAfee Ely, who hailed
      from nearby Corsicana. The couple wed on June 17, 1922. They had one child,
      Betsy Bennett Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Texas Bennett became active in the nascent Mathematical Association of
      America, which had been founded only in December 1915. In 1921 he was
      elected a member of the Council (Board of Governors). The following year he
      was elected a trustee of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and appointed to the Association’s Committee
      on Publications, and the year after that he assumed the position of editor-in-chief
      of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>’s official journal, the American Mathematical <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. In 1925
      Bennett was elected Vice-President of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> while at the same time serving
      as chair of the Texas Section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett had to forego his chairmanship of the Texas Section when he moved
      to Bethlehem, PA, later that year to accept the position of Professor and Head of
      the Department of Mathematics at Lehigh University. This marked Bennett’s
      second stay in the Philadelphia area. He held the Lehigh post for only two years
      before moving to his alma mater, Brown University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett was an inveterate problem solver and problem poser. Many of his
      contributions were published in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, beginning with problem #246 in the
      June 1916 issue, when he was an instructor at Princeton. J. B. Reynolds
      published the solution to Bennett’s problem #513 in the February 1917 issue of
      the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. Could it be mere coincidence that Reynolds taught at Lehigh? Or
      that fewer than ten years later the two would combine with H. H. Mitchell to
      found the Philadelphia Section?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett’s solution to problem #2720 in the September 1918 issue lists his
      address as C.A.R.C., Galveston, thus defining his whereabouts <q>somewhere on
      the Gulf of Mexico</q>. Curiously, Bennett lists the address for his solution to
      problem #2900 in the June/July 1921 issue of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> as the University of
      Saskatchewan, which suggests that he was a visiting professor there for the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although in his 50s, the patriotic Bennett volunteered for the Army during
      World War II, serving as a Major with the Ordnance Corps at Aberdeen once
      again from 1942 to 1946 and achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Once
      again he served under Oswald Veblen. One of the more illustrious young
      mathematicians to work under Bennett at the Ballistic Research Laboratory was
      Herman Goldstine, who wrote of his superior, <q>From time to time I was very
      impatient of Albert Bennett, who was a nice old gentleman—but he was a very
      precise, methodical, plodding person who drove me up the wall.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennett retired as emeritus professor from Brown in 1958. After that time he
      was a visiting professor at Southern Illinois, Rhode Island, and Boston College.
      He died on February 17, 1971, at the age of 82. He was a charter member of the
      <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, meaning that he had been a member for 55 years.

    <title>Profile: Howard Hawks Mitchell (1885-1943)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Howard Hawks Mitchell (1885-1943)</h></idx>
    <p>
      Howard Hawks Mitchell was one of the most accomplished members of our
      section. He first came to the area to attend graduate school, and after leaving for a
      year he joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. He lived in Merion
      and remained at Penn for the rest of his life. During that time he was one of the
      three founders of the Philadelphia Section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      H. H. Mitchell was born in Marietta, OH, on January 14, 1885, the son of
      Oscar Howard and Mary Hoadley (Hawks). His father was a well-known
      mathematics professor at Marietta College. Oscar Mitchell had been one of the
      first fellows at Johns Hopkins 1879-1882; he received his Ph.D. in 1882 for a
      dissertation in number theory. Oscar’s son’s middle name was his wife’s maiden
      name, a custom at that time for the naming of both boys and girls. The younger
      Mitchell attended local schools in Marietta and received a Ph.B. degree from
      Marietta College in 1906. (No longer in use, the notation Ph.B. is the
      abbreviation of the Latin expression for the Bachelor of Philosophy degree.) In
      1935 Marietta College conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of
      Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchell enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton in the fall of 1906,
      holding a university fellowship from 1908 to 1910. [On a related note, Carl E.
      Stromquist, the brother of the grandfather of former section president Walter
      Stromquist, was a faculty member in Princeton’s mathematics department 1903-
      1909. More famous mathematicians included Gilbert Bliss, G. D. Birkhoff, J. H.
      M. Wedderburn, and Luther Eisenhart.] Mitchell was the first doctoral student of
      Oswald Veblen, completing his dissertation on linear groups in 1910, the very
      year that fellow EPADEL founder Albert Bennett entered the graduate program.
      Bennett too would receive his Ph.D. degree under Veblen, five years later.
      Although the periods of their matriculation at Princeton had nonempty
      intersection, the lives of Mitchell and Bennett overlapped long enough to
      establish the Philadelphia Section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in 1926.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon graduation from Princeton, Mitchell was appointed an instructor in
      mathematics at the famous Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University.
      However, he remained at Yale only one year before accepting the same position
      at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught for the rest of his life.
      Altogether he supervised five Ph.D. dissertations with topics ranging from finite
      group theory to Galois fields and cyclotomic field extensions. His most well
      known student was probably Leonard Carlitz (Ph.D. 1930), who spent a very
      productive career at Duke University.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to Veblen, Mitchell had another link to an important figure in
      American mathematics. In 1911, when he began teaching at Penn, another new
      faculty member was R. L. Moore. Today R. L. Moore is widely known for his
      method of teaching and for his contributions to topology. Up to that point,
      however, Moore had not published very much. Yet Penn offered both instructors
      a stable and supportive environment, and they prospered in Philadelphia.
      Moore’s manner of teaching exerted a dominant influence on his students.
      Mitchell’s case shows that Moore played a similar role with some of his
      colleagues too. Moore’s second Ph.D. student, G. H. Hallett, Jr., took courses
      from both Moore and Mitchell. In discussing the Moore Method fifty years later,
      Hallett recalled:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
      One other course I took at the same time was somewhat similar. It was
      taught by Professor Mitchell, whom I liked very much. He took a book, I
      think it was by Dr. Pierpont, in the area of functions of a real variable. I
      guess Professor Mitchell had found on inspection that not all of Professor
      Pierpont’s proofs held up, so the way he taught this course in that subject,
      he gave us this book, but asked us to go through all the proofs that were
      given and find out whether they were watertight proofs or not and if not,
      why not. This course had many elements of the other course.
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      Mitchell married Emma Vestine White on September 18, 1912, shortly before
      the start of classes for his second year at Penn. The couple resided in the
      Philadelphia area thereafter. Like his friend Albert Bennett, Mitchell applied his
      knowledge of mathematics in World War I, serving as a ballistician with Bennett
      under their dissertation supervisor, Oswald Veblen, at the Aberdeen Proving
      Ground near Washington, D.C., in 1918.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchell held office in both the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> and the AAAS. He was on the Board of
      Trustees (now the Council) of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> from 1921 through 1923. In 1926 he was
      appointed chair of the first Committee on the Cole Prize, which was given for the
      most meritorious paper on linear algebra. He also was elected Vice President of
      the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> in 1932 and 1933, and Vice President of AAAS in 1932. In addition, he
      served a six-year stint as editor of the prestigious journal, the Transactions of the
      American Mathematical Society, from 1925 through 1930. In 1923 he was one of
      four authors of the book Algebraic Numbers, written with L. E. Dickson, H. S.
      Vandiver, and G. E. Wahlin for the National Research Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchell’s publication record was not prodigious; we have been able to locate
      only 11 items, including his dissertation and his printed solution to a <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>
      problem. Between 1913 and 1918 he published seven important papers in three
      of the country’s leading journals: two in the American Journal of Mathematics,
      one in the Annals of Mathematics, and four in the Transactions of the American
      Mathematical Society. Two appeared after that, an article on ideals in quadratic
      fields from 1926, and his final paper, which appeared in 1935 and hearkened
      back to his initial investigations on group theory and projective geometry.
      Overall, he published papers in four of the five journals that were available in
      America at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howard H. Mitchell died of coronary thrombosis on March 13, 1943, at his
      home in Merion, PA, at the age of 58. He was survived only by his wife. Overall,
      he was known as an inspiring teacher of both graduate and undergraduate
      students, and an accomplished researcher in linear groups and algebraic numbers.

    <title>Profile: Joseph Benson Reynolds (1881-1975)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Reynolds, Joseph Benson (1881-1975)</h></idx>
    <p>
      Joseph B. Reynolds was not only one of the three founders of our section, he
      was the one who initially proposed the idea of forming an <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> section in the
      Lehigh Valley. Although he was a productive scholar, he is perhaps the least
      likely of the trio to be involved in such an undertaking, because the other two had
      much deeper connections in the American mathematical community.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. B. Reynolds was born in New Castle, in the western part of Pennsylvania,
      on May 17, 1881, to Peter Stafford and Lydia Ann (Kemp) Reynolds. He was
      educated in public schools, graduating from New Castle High School in 1903.
      Considering his later accomplishments, graduation at age 22 is certainly not due
      to lack of intelligence; rather it was probably due to the need to work on the
      family farm. Upon graduation he crossed the state to enroll at Lehigh University,
      where he earned an A.B. degree four years later. The title of his undergraduate
      thesis portends an interest in applied mathematics, as well as the inclination of
      the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at the time – <q>The temperature
      compensation of the Bond sidereal clock of Sayre Observatory at Lehigh
      University</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds loved this part of the state from the outset of his undergraduate
      days. Indeed, he was associated with Lehigh in various capacities for the rest of
      his career. The first position occurred upon graduation when he accepted an
      instructorship. His bond to the area was cemented when he met and married
      Chloey B. Graham on July 2, 1908. The couple had three children: Peter Graham,
      Jane Niblock, and Joseph Benson Jr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds continued his studies while teaching at Lehigh, earning a masters
      degree in 1910. Once again he wrote a thesis with an astronomical theme, <q>The
      determination of the elements of the orbit of a minor planet: Taunton no. 94,
      ‘Lehigh’.</q> In 1928 he was promoted to professor of mathematics and theoretical
      mechanics. Could his role in the founding of the Philadelphia Section have
      played a part in the promotion? If it did, it probably was not so important as time
      spent as Acting Head of the department during 1924-1925.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. B. Reynolds was an active participant in sectional affairs. He was the first
      person to present an invited lecture at the organizational meeting in 1926, he
      served as chairman of the section in 1938-1939, and he represented the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>
      officially at the 1949 inauguration of the new president at Moravian College.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> accounted for almost all of Reynolds’ publications, with roughly
      90 of the 100 entries appearing in its Problems Department. His first endeavor
      with the journal occurred when he proposed two problems for solution in the
      May 1915 issue, one on calculus and one in mechanics. In the remainder of that
      year he was credited with solving three problems; his solution to a problem on
      mechanics posed by <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> founder B. F. Finkel was published as the most
      elegant of the correct solutions received. The following year Reynolds proposed
      three other problems and solved one more. But 1917 was a banner year for
      submissions to the Problems Department, as he was cited for 19 items – five
      posed problems, three solutions to problems posed earlier, four printed solutions,
      and seven solutions listed under <q>also solved by</q>. His last solution appeared in
      1965, exactly 50 years after his first one. He was 84 years old at the time!
    </p>
    <p>
      The succession of Reynolds’ other contributions to the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> traces his
      development as a mathematician. In the banner year 1917 he published a small
      note in the Discussions Department. However, it would be another six years
      before his first refereed paper would appear. Altogether Reynolds published eight
      refereed articles in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>, his last three appearing in Classroom Notes. Not
      all of his papers appeared in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>; two were published in the Tohuku
      Mathematical Journal and one in Agricultural Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds’ connection to theoretical mechanics is reflected in four of the six
      books he wrote. The first one, Elementary Mechanics, was published in 1928 and
      revised six years later. In between those editions he published Analytic
      Mechanics in 1931. It took eight more years to write Forty Lessons in Analytic
      Mechanics (1939), suggesting five lessons per year. His last book, Elements of
      Mechanics, written with his colleague, G. E. Raynor, was published in 1943.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this proclivity toward applied mathematics that makes Reynolds seem
      like an improbable candidate to play such a vital role in founding the
      Philadelphia Section of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>. Yet the very notion of such a section was his
      alone. In this sense the role that Reynolds played in the founding of the
      Philadelphia section is reminiscent of the roles played by the first five presidents
      of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, none of whom was a pure mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to works on mechanics, Reynolds and his colleague Frank M.
      Weida published Analytic Geometry and the Elements of Calculus in 1930.
      (Another successful calculus author from Lehigh was Lloyd L. Smail.) Overall
      Reynolds published three other books between 1918 and 1935, one of which
      appeared in two editions. The remaining work not yet described is The Peter
      Reynolds Family of Lawrence County Pennsylvania, which he published in 1940.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds’ enduring interest in both pure and applied mathematics can be seen
      in the very last note he published in the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> in 1944. Titled <q>Reversion of
      series with applications,</q> it dealt with a method for solving differential equations
      he felt was appropriate for <q>every student who is trained for engineering or other
      scientific work.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds died in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1975 at age 94. His example
      shows a competent teacher and administrator who, though he found some time
      for original investigations, contributed mainly to the Problems Department of the
      <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle>. His shared interests with astronomy and applied mathematics hearken
      back to an earlier period in the history of mathematics in America.
