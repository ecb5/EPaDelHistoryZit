  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Philadelphia Section was established in 1926 to advance the cause of
      collegiate mathematics in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and
      all of Delaware. There was no need to define <q>eastern</q> or <q>southern</q>
      because no other sections of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> covered the states of Pennsylvania or New
      Jersey at the time. However, as Philadelphia Section founder Albert A. Bennett
      so presciently predicted in 1926, the formation of a section centered at one of the
      two poles in the Keystone State would spur the establishment of a section
      centered at the other. That event transpired when the Allegheny Section was
      founded in 1933, so beginning that year the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> divided the state of
      Pennsylvania into two parts defined by longitude <m>77^\circ</m> <m>30'</m>W. This geographical
      boundary meant that much of central Pennsylvania, including notably Penn State,
      became aligned with the Pittsburgh axis. Although this arrangement removed
      from the Philadelphia Section such leading figures as Orrin Frink, Frederick
      Owens, and Helen Owens, the loss was mitigated by a new wave of energetic,
      creative leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is one reason for regarding the year 1933 as a watershed in the section’s
      history. A second reason is external to our section, even external to the country.
      And external to mathematics. It was the rise to power of the Nazi dictator Adolf
      Hitler, whose policies caused hundreds of the world’s finest scientists to
      emigrate. Five notable mathematicians settled in the Philadelphia area – Emmy
      Noether, Salomon Bochner, Hilda Geiringer, Hans Rademacher, and Richard
      Courant. All but Noether participated in our section.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter describes activities in the Philadelphia Section from the first
      annual meeting held outside Pennsylvania, in 1933, to the one held two weeks
      before the United States entered World War II in 1941. The chapter introduces a
      new set of leaders and describes some of their professional activities. Perhaps the
      most active of them all – J. A. Shohat – is, like Hans Rademacher, accorded a
      personal profile at the end of the chapter as a tribute to his many contributions.
      The five new chairs of the section are associated with five different institutions –
      W. M. Smith (Lafayette), Richard Morris (Rutgers), J. W. Clawson (Ursinus), L.
      L. Smail (Lehigh), and C. O. Oakley (Haverford). There are also biographical
      sketches of two members of the Program Committee – C. B. Allendoerfer
      (Haverford) and H. W. Brinkmann (Swarthmore) – and one invited lecturer, A.
      G. Rau (Moravian). The chapter ends by analyzing the themes of the invited
      lectures, with a discussion of those addresses delivered by émigrés
      complementing an analysis by mathematical category.

    The 1933 meeting was the first official function sponsored by the section that
    did not include mathematicians from central Pennsylvania. Moreover, whereas
    the University of Pennsylvania and Lehigh University hosted all but one of the
    initial seven meetings, a diversity of sites emerged in the period under
    consideration, with three colleges – Lafayette, Haverford, and Ursinus – each
    hosting a meeting for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining columns provide attendance figures at these meetings. They
    show that attendance remained fairly steady, except for the small gathering at
    Ursinus College in 1938. On average about 30 of the 51 people who attended
    these nine meetings belonged to the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> (59%), figures concordant with
    attendance at the first seven meetings.

  <title>Leaders</title>
  <p>
    <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter</xref> described the outstanding leadership the section received from a
    cadre of members who sustained the vitality, initially provided by the section’s
    three founders, from the organizational meeting in 1926 through 1932. As we
    have seen, the chairmen of the section during the period of establishment came
    from Philadelphia, the suburbs, the Lehigh Valley, and from outside the present
    section’s boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="Table8">Table</xref> addresses the section’s governance structure based on elections held
    at annual fall meetings from 1933 through 1941. Recall our convention that the
    year 1933 means that P. A. Caris was elected as secretary at the meeting in 1933
    but carried out most of his duties during 1934. Caris continued to serve as
    secretary until 1941, whereupon Philip M. Whitman continued the unwritten
    tradition that the section’s secretary come from the University of Pennsylvania.
    Caris remained active in the section up to the time of his death in 1960, being
    elected chairman twice, in 1945 and 1950.
  </p>
  <p><foreign>Chairs</foreign></p>
  <p>
    During this period the section prospered under nine different chairmen, only
    two of whom had been elected to office during the first seven years, H. H.
    Mitchell and Arnold Dresden. These nine represent geographical areas within the
    Philadelphia Section that are more scattered than during the preceding period: H.
    H. Mitchell and J. A. Shohat were from the University of Pennsylvania in
    Philadelphia, while J. Clawson (Ursinus College), A. Dresden (Swarthmore
    College), and C. O. Oakley (Haverford College) came from the suburbs. Three
    chairmen came from the Lehigh Valley: L. L. Smail and J. B. Reynolds from
    Lehigh University and W. M. Smith from neighboring Lafayette College. The
    remaining chairman was Richard Morris of Rutgers University. It might be
    pointed out that by the end of this period no representative from the University of
    Delaware had yet served as chairman of the section, a situation that would
    change dramatically in the 1940s.

    The contributions that James Alexander Shohat made to the section warrant
    him a personal profile at the end of the chapter. Shohat emigrated from Russia in
    1923, arriving a decade before the European wave that splashed ashore between
    1933 and 1941. He became a naturalized citizen in 1929, but it was not until
    1930 that he first visited the area, delivering an invited lecture at the section’s
    annual meeting. He moved to Philadelphia in 1931 as an assistant professor at the
    University of Pennsylvania, and remained there the rest of his life.

    Since the careers of Arnold Dresden, Howard Mitchell, and James Reynolds
    have already been profiled, we provide biographical sketches of the five other
    chairmen in the order of their terms.

    <li>
      <p>
        <alert>William Mackey (<q>Will</q>) Smith</alert> (1881-1966) is a native of Oxford, PA.
        He received a Ph. B. (Bachelor of Philosophy) degree from Lafayette
        College in 1903, and joined the faculty of his alma mater two years later as
        an instructor. However, he left that post for two years to enroll in the
        graduate program at Columbia University, where he received a Ph.D. in
        1911. Smith then returned to Lafayette for a year before accepting an
        assistant professorship at the University of Oregon. Although promoted to
        full professor there after only one year, he returned to Lafayette as an
        associate professor in 1915 and remained at the Easton college for the rest of
        his life. He was appointed head of the department in 1934, a year after
        serving as the section’s chair. Like many Americans, Smith’s career was
        interrupted by World War II, when he served as the Director of War Studies
        at Lafayette from 1943 through 1945. He died in 1966 at the age of 85.

      <p>
        <alert>Richard Morris</alert> (1868-1951), who was born in Keyport, New Jersey,
        graduated from Peddie Institute in 1890. Even though it would be another
        six years before he would enroll at Rutgers, he entered as a sophomore
        because in the meantime he had acquired state certificates through study and
        teaching experience. He graduated from Rutgers with a B.S. in 1899 at age
        30. That fall he served as superintendent of nearby schools, but at the same
        time he accepted an instructorship in the Department of Mathematics and
        Graphics and initiated graduate studies at his alma mater. He earned an M.S.
        in 1902. While Morris continued to be listed on the faculty at Rutgers, he
        pursued graduate studies at Cornell University, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1907.
        Upon graduation, Morris returned to Rutgers for the rest of his life, ending
        up teaching 45 years there. In 1918 he volunteered to teach at the new
        branch of the university, the New Jersey College for Women. Later he
        headed the department there; he also served as head of the mathematics
        department of the men’s colleges from 1913 to 1944. Morris was 66 years
        old when elected chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1934. He retired as
        emeritus professor ten years later at age 76. Even at that point he devoted his
        time to tutoring Rutgers students, serving as a substitute teacher in the
        public schools, and filling vacancies in various pulpits of Methodist
        churches in the area. Morris died in New Brunswick at the age of 83.

      <p>
        <alert>John Wentworth Clawson</alert> (1881-1964) was born in St. John, New
        Brunswick. He took his bachelors and masters degrees from New Brunswick
        College in 1901 and 1905. In between he studied at Cambridge University in
        England. Clawson came to the department of mathematics and physics at
        Ursinus College in 1907. He taught at Ursinus and lived in Collegeville the
        rest of his life, spending the years 1947-1952 as dean of the college.
        Clawson was a charter member of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in 1916 and was elected
        chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1935. Earlier he served two one-
        year stints on the Program Committee (now the Executive Committee) of
        the section, in 1930 and 1933. Clawson retired as emeritus professor in 1952
        at age 70. He was an inveterate problem solver, beginning with his
        published solution to a problem in the January 1909 issue of the Monthly,
        ending with the solution to an Advanced Problem in the June/July 1957
        issue, and including solutions to over 50 other problems in between. J. W.
        Clawson died in 1964 after having been an <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> member for 48 years.

      <p>
        <alert>Lloyd Leroy Smail</alert> (1888-1955) was born in Kansas. He received two
        degrees from the University of Washington at Seattle, an A.B. in 1911 and
        an A.M. in 1912. The following year he received a Ph.D. from Columbia
        University. He then returned to the West Coast as an instructor at his alma
        mater. Smail left Washington for the University of Oregon two years later.
        He remained at Oregon for two years before heading to the University of
        Texas, but he left there after only one year to accept a position at Lehigh
        University. After relatively short durations at three land-grant universities,
        Smail stayed at Lehigh from 1926 until his retirement as emeritus professor
        in 1953. He was active in the Philadelphia Section since becoming one of its
        charter members in the fall of his arrival on the Bethlehem campus. In fact,
        he presented an invited lecture at the organizational meeting in November
        1926. One month later he spoke at the national <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>/<url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> meeting at the
        University of Pennsylvania, with both lectures centering on Dedekind’s
        theory of irrational numbers. Smail spoke again at the 1931 annual meeting
        of the Philadelphia Section. His last official participation with the section
        was his election to the Program Committee in 1947. When he died at age 66
        he had been a member of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> for 31 years.

      <p>
        <alert>Cletus Odia Oakley</alert> (1899-1990) was born in Texas. Today he is best
        known for his textbooks, especially his 1955 work Principles of
        Mathematics written with Carl B. Allendoerfer. After serving a one-year
        tour of duty with the U. S. Navy in 1918-1919 Oakley obtained three
        degrees in three-year increments, beginning with a bachelors from the
        University of Texas in 1923. After a one-year stint as an engineer with
        Western Electric Company, he accepted an instructorship at Brown
        University, where he stayed for two years, leaving in 1926 with a masters
        degree. He received his Ph.D. in 1929 at the University of Illinois under
        Robert Carmichael. Upon graduation Oakley returned to Brown to teach for
        another five years. He then came to Haverford College in 1934 and spent the
        rest of his life on the Main Line campus, serving as head of the department
        from 1942 until his retirement in June 1964. Of course he took several
        leaves during this tenure, with sabbaticals in 1947-1948, 1955-1956, and
        1960-1961, and a leave of absence in 1952-1953. In addition to eight
        textbooks, Oakley published 14 papers (mostly on differential and integral
        equations) and served as associate editor of the Monthly for five years. In
        addition he was the chair of the mathematics committee of the College
        Entrance Examination Board and editor-in-chief of the mathematics section
        in Collier’s Encyclopedia. Oakley was also known as an excellent lecturer
        who was supported by the NSF to address teachers in states along the
        Atlantic seaboard. At Haverford, however, he was best known among
        students for his athletic prowess, especially in handball; a standing offer
        held that any student who beat him was guaranteed an A in his class. He
        defeated all comers into his late sixties. Upon retirement Oakley spent two
        years on a Fulbright grant, his fourth, working with teachers in Australia. He
        died at age 91 in Ann Arbor, where he lived with his son, a professor of
        psychology at the University of Michigan.

  <p><foreign>Program Committee</foreign></p>
  <p>
    Next we discuss the composition of the section’s Program Committee (today’s
    Executive Committee). During the period 1933-1941 a total of 15 different
    individuals were elected to the Committee. Ordinarily three people served on this
    committee, but in 1936 there were only two; the official report from the meeting
    held at Lafayette does not explain this anomaly. The notation (C) in the bottom
    row of <xref ref="Table8">Table</xref> denotes the chairman, a designation that began only in 1941.
  </p>
  <p>
    Membership on the Program Committee came from colleges and universities
    located in the city of Philadelphia, its environs, the Lehigh Valley, and New
    Jersey, but it did not include representation from Delaware or the northern or
    western part of the section’s geographical boundaries. Altogether 15 different
    individuals served the 26 terms in this period. The suburban Philadelphia area
    dominated membership on the Committee, with 12 terms (46%): Swarthmore
    College’s three members served six terms (Brinkmann four; Dresden and Wilson
    one each), Haverford College’s two members served three terms (Oakley two,
    Allendoerfer one), while Ursinus College’s Clawson served two terms and Bryn
    Mawr’s Hedlund served one. The Lehigh Valley came next in representation,
    with 6 terms (23%): Lehigh University provided three terms (Fort two and
    Lehmer one) and so did Lafayette College (Smith served all three). The city of
    Philadelphia garnered five terms (19%): the University of Pennsylvania provided
    four (Shohat three, Kline one), while Drexel Institute’s Davis served one. In
    addition, Rutgers University’s Morris served two terms, while the New Jersey
    College for Women’s Nelson, also located at Rutgers, served one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the preceding period, almost all members of the Program Committee,
    11 of the 15, were elected chairman of the section at one time or another from
    1928 to 1952. A chronological listing of the chairmen suggests the extent of this
    group’s influence, especially during the 1930s: 1928 (Wilson), 1930 (Fort), 1931
    (Dresden), 1932 (Kline), 1933 (Smith), 1934 (Morris), 1935 (Clawson), 1939
    (Shohat), 1940 (Dresden), 1941 (Oakley), 1942 (Davis), 1944 (Nelson), and 1952
    (Nelson). Recall our convention that brief biographies of chairs appear in the
    chapters covering the year of the first term. Two members of the Committee are
    deserving of special mention.

    <li>
      <p>
        <alert>Carl Barnett Allendoerfer</alert> (1911-1974) graduated from Haverford College
        in 1932, after which he held a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to Cambridge
        University before receiving his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1937.
        Allendoerfer joined the faculty at his alma mater Haverford College in 1946
        but stayed there only five years, one of which (1948-1949) was spent at the
        Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He then went to the University of
        Washington, where he became one of the most active members of the
        national <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url>, serving as President for 1959-1960. Upon his death in 1974
        the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> honored him by establishing Allendoerfer Awards for outstanding
        expository articles in Mathematics Magazine.

    <li>
      <p>
        <alert>Heinrich Wilhelm Brinkmann</alert> (1898-1989) was born in Hanover,
        Germany. Heine Brinkmann received all his higher education in the U.S.
        and ultimately became a naturalized citizen. He earned a bachelors degree
        from Stanford University in 1920 and then accepted an instructorship there
        for a year. During this period he was strongly interested in group theory by
        Hans Blichfeldt, and he helped W. A. Manning write his book Primitive
        Groups. During the summer of 1922 G. D. Birkhoff became Stanford’s first
        visiting professor. He met Brinkmann and prompted him to apply to
        Harvard for graduate school. When the prestigious university officially
        offered Brinkmann admission to the graduate program later that year, he
        replied with a terse telegraph message, <q>Yes.</q> He earned a masters degree in
        1923 and a Ph.D. in 1925, while holding a Sheldon Fellowship during 1923-
        1924. He wrote his dissertation on Riemann spaces under Birkhoff. After
        graduation, Brinkmann spent a post-doctoral year with Emmy Noether at
        Göttingen before returning to Harvard as a faculty member. He was a very
        popular teacher; 50 years later his former student J. L. Brenner recalled,
        <q>Brinkmann’s classes were among the most brilliantly organized ... he
        raised questions in just the right way.</q> In 1933 Brinkmann moved to
        Swarthmore College, where he remained for the rest of his life. He held the
        College’s Magill Professorship from 1957 to 1965 and the Buffington
        Professorship from 1965 until his retirement four years later. In 1971 he and
        future section chair Eugene Klotz published the book Linear Algebra and
        Analytic Geometry. Like several Swarthmore mathematicians, Brinkmann
        played musical instruments. He became one of the most active
        mathematicians in the Philadelphia Section during the 1930s, serving a
        record four terms on the Program Committee. He also delivered invited
        lectures at annual meetings in 1933, 1941, and 1955. Heine Brinkmann died
        at age 90 in nearby Wallingford.

    <xref ref="Table9">Table</xref> lists information about the invited lectures at the annual meetings of
    the Philadelphia Section from 1933 to 1941. During those nine years the section
    sponsored 38 addresses by 32 individuals associated with 19 different
    institutions.
    The table reveals that four different faculty members from the University of
    Pennsylvania presented a total of six lectures in this period, with James Shohat
    and Hans Rademacher speaking twice, and James A. Clarkson and E. E. Witmer
    once each. Shohat and Rademacher are profiled at the end of the chapter. Next
    came Princeton University with three different speakers who delivered four talks:
    Samuel S. Wilks (2), Salomon Bochner, and Albert W. Tucker.

  <title>Themes of Lectures</title>
<p>
First we discuss the invited lectures delivered by émigré mathematicians who
settled in the region. Then we examine the lectures by their mathematical
classification: analysis, geometry/topology, algebra/number theory, probability/
statistics, curriculum/pedagogy, and special topics.
</p>

  <p><foreign>Émigrés</foreign></p>
<p>
Like the rest of the country, the Philadelphia Section benefited enormously
from mathematicians forced to flee their homeland. During the period 1933-1941
six invited lectures were given by four different émigré mathematicians, all of
whom chose to speak on some aspect of analysis except for Richard Courant,
who spoke on applied mathematics.
</p>
<p>
The preceding chapter discussed the 1930 lecture by one immigrant from the
1920s, James A. Shohat. The Penn professor accepted two more invitations in the
1930s, the first at the 1934 meeting held at Penn. In this lecture Shohat showed
that the trapezoidal formula and Simpson’s Rule for approximating a definite
integral could be derived by a simple application of Taylor’s Formula.
</p>
<p>
The 1939 annual meeting held at Lehigh provided the highlight of Shohat’s
association with the Philadelphia Section. At the business part of the meeting,
held between the morning and afternoon sessions, he was elected chairman of the
section for the next year. On the program he presented a talk contrasting
Lagrangian and Hermitian interpolations of certain orthogonal polynomials,
based on recent results of Bernstein, Faber, and Fejér.
</p>
<p>
Princeton’s Salomon Bochner was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1899. He was
forced to leave his position of lecturer in Munich, Germany, in 1932, and just one
year later Oswald Veblen arranged a faculty appointment for Bochner at
Princeton. Two years after that, in Bochner’s 1935 talk to the Philadelphia
Section, he presented an outline of the theory of periodic and almost-periodic
functions as viewed from the theory of expansions of general functions on
groups. He emphasized that his approach explained adequately why the
exponentials formed a complete system of pure periodic functions of one
variable. We do not know the cause of James Shohat’s emigration from Russia in
1923 but there is no doubt why Salomon Bochner left Poland – to avoid the Nazi
persecution of Jews. Bochner always remained grateful to the United States for
saving his life.
</p>
<p>
Hans Rademacher, the third émigré to speak to the Philadelphia Section, also
left his native Germany to avoid Nazi persecution, but not for religious reasons.
Rademacher was a Protestant who became a Quaker when he came to
Philadelphia. He was dismissed from his position as full professor at the
University of Breslau in 1933 because he belonged to the International League
for the Rights of Man and was president of the Breslau chapter of the German
Society for Peace.
</p>
<p>
During his lifetime Hans Rademacher presented four invited lectures at
annual meetings of the Philadelphia Section, two during the period
under consideration, the first at the 1937 meeting at Haverford
College. A distinguished figure in analysis and analytic number
theory, he chose to speak about Bernoulli numbers in his initial
talk. Here he regarded the general binomial coefficient <m>n\choose
j</m> as an integral-valued polynomial of the <m>j^{th}</m> degree,
which was then expressed as a linear combination of binomial
coefficients by means of integral coefficients <m>A_{q j}</m> . The
resulting formula yielded the <m>(q + 1)^{th}</m> Bernoulli
polynomial. The master number theorist used this fact to prove that
the Von Staudt theorem followed as a direct consequence of a
congruence property of the <m>A_{q j}</m>.
</p>
<p>
Rademacher delivered his second invited lecture to the Section at the 1940
annual meeting at his home institution, the University of Pennsylvania. On this
occasion he spoke about one of his favorite topics, Dedekind sums, based on a
forthcoming paper written with his first Ph.D. student at Penn, Albert Whitman.
Rademacher lectured on an arithmetical property of Dedekind sums called the
<q>theorem of reciprocity</q>.
</p>
<p>
The lecture by the remaining émigré, Richard Courant, is noteworthy for
several reasons. For one, it was the last lecture delivered during the period under
discussion. For another, the subject matter was one dear to the speaker’s heart:
applied mathematics. Another émigré, Lipman Bers, commenting on the value of
many immigrants’ knowledge of applied mathematics, wrote, <q>Almost overnight,
refugee mathematicians became a boon rather than a burden.</q> Like Bochner,
Courant had been born in Poland but educated in Germany, obtaining his
doctorate under David Hilbert at Göttingen in 1910. He was professor of
mathematics and Director of the Mathematical Institute at Göttingen from 1920
until his dismissal by the Nazis in 1933. After spending the next academic year at
Cambridge University, Courant crossed the ocean to become a professor of
mathematics and head of the department at New York University. He held both
posts until his retirement in 1958. Curiously, the fascinating biography of
Courant by Constance Reid does not mention his lecture to our section.
</p>
<p>
The title of Courant’s lecture was <q>Problems of stability and instability
demonstrated by soap film experiments</q>. In it he stated that if a dynamical
system permits different states of stable equilibrium, corresponding to relative
minima of the potential energy, there must exist transitions between these two
states leading over an intermediary state of unstable equilibrium. Courant then
demonstrated the principle with soap film experiments of a novel type, relating to
minimal surfaces and systems of such surfaces. After that Courant discussed how
these experiments pointed to a new field within the calculus of variations. He
ended his talk by linking the newly formulated problems to classical
isoperimetric problems.
</p>
<p>
Before discussing other invited lectures during 1933-1941, we pause to
mention another one on applied mathematics. Given at the 1935 meeting, Penn’s
Enos Eby Witmer spoke on <q>Quantum mechanics</q>. In his talk Witmer viewed
the development of quantum theory as developed by Planck in terms of the
history of classical physics. His major theme was that every physical problem
should be approached as an eigenvalue problem. He concluded, <q>and that is what
quantum mechanics is.</q>
</p>
<p><foreign>Analysis</foreign></p>
<p>
The section above described lectures on analysis by James Shohat, Salomon
Bochner, and Hans Rademacher. From 1933 to 1941 five other speakers chose to
speak on a theme from analysis. Altogether 10 of the 38 talks presented to the
Philadelphia Section during the nine-year period under discussion were on
analysis, which reflects a slight de-emphasis from the period 1928-1932, which
featured 8 of 23.
</p>
<p>
Haverford’s Cletus O. Oakley delivered two invited addresses during the
1930s. In 1934 he lectured on ordinary differential equations. The title of his
1939 talk, <q>Equations of polygonal configurations,</q> belies its content, which
concerned semilinear equations involving linear forms. By invoking properties of
linear operators, Oakley thereby introduced many of the members to topics in
modern functional analysis.
</p>
<p>
A lecture given three years earlier removed all doubt about the intrusion of
<q>soft analysis</q> into the area. In his 1936 talk, Penn’s James A. Clarkson
discussed convexity properties of Banach spaces and their subsets, the first time
such spaces were mentioned officially at a meeting of the Section. In his talk
Clarkson presented a simple proof of the Radon-Riesz theorem on weak
convergence in <m>L_p</m> spaces for <m>p > 1</m>.
</p>
<p>
Two Bryn Mawr College professors also spoke on analysis. In 1935 Gustav
Arnold Hedlund took a rather nontraditional approach to dynamical systems.
Hedlund’s lecture did not feature the usual particles. Instead he considered
Euclidean and non-Euclidean billiards with a single ball, which maintains its
velocity and is reflected from the sides at equal angles. In her 1938 lecture Anna
Pell Wheeler presented a study of the correspondence between certain classes of
functions analytic in the interior of the unit circle.
</p>
<p>
P. T. Maker of Rutgers University preceded Courant’s talk at the 1941
meeting held at Penn. Like Pell Wheeler, Maker spoke about analytic functions.
In his talk he discussed the contribution of measure theory to the problem of
relaxing conditions in order for a function of a complex variable to be analytic,
ending by generalizing the Cauchy theorem to functions on closed sets.
</p>

<p><foreign>Geometry/Topology</foreign></p>
<p>
Eight lectures at the annual meetings of the Philadelphia Section held from
1933 to 1941 were devoted to topics in topology or geometry. Although the
previous five-year period witnessed lectures by Princeton topologists James
Alexander and Morris Knebelman, nobody from that famous school of
topologists spoke during the period at hand. Nonetheless, the three talks devoted
to topology maintained the quality achieved by the earlier speakers.
</p>
<p>
The earliest address on topology was an expository talk by Raymond L.
Wilder, one of the first graduates of the Texas school of topology under R. L.
Moore. At the time of his lecture Wilder was at the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton on leave from Michigan. In his talk he outlined the development of
various notions of connectivity in higher dimensional polyhedrals, then he
described recent extensions of these ideas to arbitrary topological spaces.
</p>
<p>
The next lecture on topology was given by Stuart S. Cairns of Lehigh
University, who spoke on the deep subject of simplicial complexes in both point
set and algebraic topology, the latter then known as <q>combinatorial topology</q>.
After presenting his solution to a problem involving regular manifolds, Cairns
applied the material to the usual definition of arc length before supplying a proof
of the generalized Stokes Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The third, and final, invited lecture on topology was given by one of the
section’s most active members, John C. Oxtoby of Bryn Mawr College, who was
elected chairman of the section in 1955. Oxtoby opened the 1940 meeting at
Penn by discussing transitive flows, a topic that deals with one-parameter
continuous groups of automorphisms of a topological space. As is typical of
many aspects of Lie groups, this material was applied to the theory of differential
equations.
</p>
<p>
The five talks on geometry during this period dealt with five entirely different
aspects of the subject. At the 1940 meeting John Oxtoby was followed by J. L.
Vanderslice of Lehigh University, who gave an expository talk on
generalizations of classical differential geometry in which he supplied evidence
for the indispensability of tensors and tensor differentiation. Two years earlier R.
C. Yates of the University of Maryland presented a lecture titled <q>Linkages</q>.
After presenting a history of the subject from the common pantograph of
Scheiner in 1631 to work by J. J. Sylvester, the speaker exhibited several
working models of linkages designed for line motion, trisection, and the
description of conics and many higher plane curves. Yates would speak to the
section again in 1951, at which time he had moved to the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point. In 1934 J. Alfred Benner of Lafayette College spoke about a
certain class of curves defined by polar equations.

        in 1922 and two masters degrees, one from Lafayette in 1925
        and another from Columbia four years later. J.  Alfred Benner
        spent his entire career at Lafayette, being appointed an
        instructor in 1922 and eventually promoted to full professor
        in 1950.

In 1933 Heinrich Brinkmann of Swarthmore College spoke about projective
geometry, a topic also discussed by Penn State’s Frederick Owens in 1937.
Owens presented an expository paper centered around one theorem: the
impossibility of constructing three distinct triangles, real or imaginary, for which
each triangle is in six-fold perspective with each of the others. Helen Owens
spoke before the section two years later. The fact that the Allegheny Section
scheduled annual meetings in the spring enabled mathematicians who had
formerly been active in our section to continue their formal ties.

<p><foreign>Algebra/Number Theory</foreign></p>
<p>
During the period 1933-1941 there was only one invited lecture at the
Philadelphia Section that truly fits into the classification of algebra. In the last
year of the period Heinrich Brinkmann discussed the relations between the
discriminant of a cubic polynomial and its roots, concluding with an elementary
proof of a theorem due to Voroni. Since this topic deals with the classical algebra
of polynomials, it means that the section had still not heard a talk about any part
of the abstract algebra that was developed in the late 1920s and throughout the
1930s, even though the acknowledged leader in the field, Emmy Noether, taught
at Bryn Mawr College from 1933 until 1935. In fact, the renowned algebraist
Nathan Jacobson replaced Noether at Bryn Mawr, but there is no record of his
participation in the section either. Edward Kasner of Columbia University gave
an invited lecture on a related topic at the annual meeting in 1933. Titled
<q>Polygons and groups,</q> he extended results from a <m>1903</m> <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> article to bi-
point transformations connected with a given polygon.
</p>
<p>
In spite of a dearth of talks on modern algebra, the period 1933-1941 bore
witness to five invited lectures on number theory. In the first year Emory P.
Starke of Rutgers University discussed binomial congruences on a level
accessible to undergraduate students. Starke continued to be active in sectional
affairs, serving as chairman for the year 1946-1947. Two of the section’s invited
talks on number theory were delivered at the 1937 meeting at Haverford College.
The one by Hans Rademacher was described above; the Rutgers mathematician
H. S. Grant gave the other, on Farey series. In 1941 Richard P. Bailey of
Lafayette College gave a talk whose title suggests geometry, <q>The problem of the
square pyramid,</q> but instead deals with integral solutions of systems of equations
based on the work of the French number theorist, F. E. A. Lucas.
</p>
<p>
The final lecture on number theory was the opening presentation at the 1939
meeting held at Lehigh University. The title of D. H. Lehmer’s talk has a very
modern ring to it, <q>Mechanical aids to the theory of numbers</q>. In it he described
commercial multiplying machines and their adaptations, punch card equipment,
sieve and stencil devices, and his own recently constructed electric sieve.
</p>

<p><foreign>Probability/Statistics</foreign></p>
<p>
During the 1930s the section sponsored talks on two emerging areas,
probability and statistics, by one person, Samuel Stanley Wilks, of Princeton.
The first talk was given at the 1935 meeting at Penn. Titled <q>Inverse probability
and fiducial inference,</q> Wilks explained some of the difficulties that arise in
attempting to apply Bayes’s Theorem on inverse probability to the problem of
drawing inferences about unknown population parameters from observations, and
conditions under which such difficulties can be avoided by fiducial arguments.
</p>
<p>
S. S. Wilks spoke a second time five years later, at the 1940 meeting again at
the University of Pennsylvania. The title of his presentation was <q>Statistics
involved in College Entrance Examinations</q>. In this invited lecture he discussed
statistical problems that arise in the construction and reading of examinations,
particularly those administered by the College Entrance Examination Board.
Wilks stressed that to secure maximum reliability in an examination with a given
number of questions, care must be taken to select items of suitable difficulty
satisfying the subject-matter requirements such that the correct and incorrect
responses on each pair of questions are highly positively correlated.
</p>
<p><foreign>Curriculum/Pedagogy</foreign></p>
<p>
Five papers presented at the 1932-1941 annual meetings dealt with some
aspect of education, two each at the meetings in 1935 and 1938 and one in 1936.
Three of the lectures concerned the college curriculum exclusively, one focused
on secondary mathematics, and the remaining one bridged the gap between high
school and college.
</p>
<p>
At the 1938 meeting, the first hosted by Ursinus, Albert W. Tucker described
the two one-semester geometry courses he offered at Princeton. One of them,
called an <q>Introduction to Modern Geometry,</q> was designed for sophomores and
dealt with geometries characterized by their groups of transformations. The other,
<q>Elementary Topology,</q> was a course constructed for juniors. It dealt with
topological properties in two and three dimensions, including the classification of
2-dimensional manifolds and examples of 3-dimensional manifolds, culminating
in properties of general topological spaces. By examining manifolds in <m>\cal R^3</m>,
Tucker anticipated a topic that would earn Fields Medals for four mathematicians
in the second half of the <m>20^{th}</m> century: John Milnor in 1962, Steven Smale in
1966, William Thurston in 1982, and Michael Freedman in 1986.
</p>
<p>
In 1936 W. R. Murray of Franklin and Marshall College described the
undergraduate comprehensive examination developed by the faculty at F &amp; M.
Murray maintained that although F &amp; M’s system of comprehensive
examinations offered decided advantages in coordinating a student’s course of
study, it was more difficult to construct in mathematics than in other areas. In
spite of observing several desirable gains, <q>the experiment is still too new and the
operation too imperfect to make any enthusiastic claims for the plan.</q> Apparently
the system of comprehensive exams flourished until the 1960s, when they began
to disappear across the college. The major hurdle seemed to be the conundrum of
the student who, having passed all courses, performed poorly on the
comprehensive exams. In mathematics, one of the consequences was to lower the
level of the exam to meet the students’ achievement, clearly not the intention of
the system. Sometime in the early 1970s Franklin &amp; Marshall eliminated
comprehensive examinations altogether.
</p>
<p>
At the tenth meeting of the section in 1935, the first at Lafayette College, the
leadoff speaker was Richard P. Bailey from the host institution. His colleague
Will Smith, who was chairman of the Section in 1934-1935 and served three
terms on the Program Committee in the nine-year period under discussion,
introduced him. The section’s secretary, Perry Caris, described Bailey’s talk in
one sentence: <q>Doctor Bailey presented the results of a survey of the mathematics
curricula of the colleges of the Philadelphia Section, calling attention in
particular to the most prevalent types of curriculum organization and the major
problems to which they give rise.</q> Unfortunately, no further details were
provided. Bailey himself had just come to Lafayette that year as an instructor in
mathematics, and he remained at Lafayette until 1944. Certainly Secretary Caris
knew about Bailey’s work in mathematics, because Bailey had just completed his
doctoral dissertation at Penn under James Shohat a few months before delivering
his invited lecture to the section.
</p>
<p>
At that same meeting Albert G. Rau, the Dean at Moravian College, presented
his research on the history of the curriculum at Moravian secondary schools and
at Moravian College. He indicated that teachers in the Moravian schools were
acquainted with algebra and geometry; these subjects became part of the
curriculum after 1780. This background enabled Moravian College to add conic
sections into the curriculum after 1820. Analytic geometry and calculus were
added after 1860 but were discontinued from about 1870 until 1900, perhaps due
to the growing tradition at some Lehigh Valley colleges of students burning their
calculus books at the end of the year. Rau concluded his paper by stating, <q>The
general question of mathematics in other Pennsylvania German schools can not
be examined for lack of evidence and is postponed for a later paper.</q> We do not
know if Dean Rau ever pursued his research further in this direction, but we
pause to introduce this active member of our section.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <alert>Albert George Rau</alert> (1868-1942) is the only person to speak to our section
who was a full-time administrator his whole professional life. Born on
August 7, 1868, in Bethlehem, PA, Rau obtained his bachelors degree from
Lehigh University in 1888. In spite of graduating shortly before his 20th
birthday, Rau assumed the position of Superintendent of the Moravian
Preparatory School that September. He remained in that post until 1909,
when he was appointed Dean of the Moravian College and Theological
Seminary. Rau attended school in the evening, resulting in a masters degree
from Lehigh in 1900 and a Ph.D. from Moravian in 1910. His publications
show a wide breadth of interest, a trait reflected in his professional
memberships. Rau not only belonged to the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> and the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>, but to the
American Society for Political and Social Science, perhaps being the only
member in the intersection of these three sets. Except for a one-year leave as
lecturer on rural sociology at the Teachers College of Columbia University
in 1927, Rau retained his deanship until his death on February 23, 1942.

</ul>
</p>
<p>
Being the second speaker at the 1938 meeting, Albert W. Tucker discussed his
two topology courses before the business meeting, conducted right before lunch.
After the meal the audience was treated to another lecture dealing with education,
but this one at the secondary level. The speaker, W. D. Carpenter, a mathematics
teacher at the private Germantown Academy in Philadelphia, centered his talk
about two issues. The first was the growing influence of the College Board
Examinations. Carpenter felt that the inclusion of elementary calculus and
analytic geometry would cause a lack of thoroughness in the other subjects
taught, a theme repeated by many college teachers in the 1980s and 1990s. Next
the speaker addressed criticisms of secondary mathematics, again anticipating
basic issues that would arise 50 years later. He put the blame for the poor
preparation of high-school teachers squarely on the shoulders of the college
faculty themselves, and then he laid out a plan of improved methods in the
training of future teachers.
</p>

<p><foreign>Special Topics</foreign></p> 
<p>
Four of the talks delivered to the Philadelphia Section in the 1930s do not fit
into any of the categories above but are too important to overlook. In 1934
Charles N. Moore presented an invited lecture in which he compared
mathematics and poetry on the basis of certain common aesthetic elements.
Moore spent the 1934-35 academic year at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton on leave from his usual post at the University of Cincinnati. He had
served as vice-president of the <url href="https://www.maa.org">MAA</url> in 1931.
</p>
<p>
In 1937 Albert Harry Wheeler, a high-school teacher from Worcester,
Massachusetts, presented a talk titled <q>Stellated polyhedra, illustrated by
models</q>. In his presentation Wheeler showed by means of paper models some
unusual transformations of solids. In addition to paper models he showed
photographs of many forms of stellated polyhedra, probably passing the photos
among the 57 listeners in the room because overhead projectors were not yet in
use.
</p>
<p>
The annual meeting at Lehigh in 1939 included two invited lectures on special
topics. One was by Dr. Elmer Johnson from the Schwenkfelder Library in
Pennsburg, PA, who exhibited numerous old mathematical books and surveying
instruments in the library’s collections. He also discussed the history of some of
those books and instruments, including facts concerning their acquisition.
</p>
<p>
The other lecture was by Penn State’s Helen B. Owens, whose title was
<q>Mathematics clubs, old and new</q>. We have already discussed Helen and her
husband, Frederick, during the time Penn State was aligned with the Philadelphia
Section, and even after the formation of the Allegheny Section in 1933. Here
Owens suggested various activities that could be used to stimulate interest in
mathematics among undergraduate students, including the use of problem
contests, joint club meetings, mathematical exhibits (like the one described by
Albert Wheeler above), public lectures, and student mathematical publications.
The section’s Deborah A. Frantz, the indefatigable Kutztown University
professor who served as EPADEL’s Student Chapter Coordinator throughout the
1990s, carried out every one of these activities in that decade.

  <title>Profile: Hans Rademacher (1892-1969)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h>Hans Rademacher</h></idx>
<p>
Hans Rademacher was one of several émigré mathematicians to settle in the
Philadelphia area during the 1930s. Born in Hamburg, Germany, it seemed as if
this brilliant student would follow in the footsteps of other outstanding research
mathematicians produced by the country’s superior educational system when he
obtained his doctorate at Göttingen in 1917 at age 25.
</p>
<p>
From there Rademacher began to climb the steep German academic ladder.
During 1919-1922 he was a Privatdocent at the University of Berlin. Then he
moved back to his native Hamburg to become Professor Extraordinarius.
However, he remained in Hamburg only three years before accepting a position
as Professor Ordinarius (the equivalent of a full professor) at the University of
Breslau in 1925. He stayed in Breslau until 1934.
</p>
<p>
That’s when Rademacher’s life changed dramatically. He was a socialist who
belonged to the International League for the Rights of Man and was president of
the Breslau chapter of the German Society for Peace, any one of which was
sufficient to get him fired by the ruling Nazis. He was dismissed
unceremoniously in 1934.
</p>
<p>
Germany’s loss was the Philadelphia Section’s gain.
</p>
<p>
In the fall of 1934 Rademacher immigrated to the University of Pennsylvania
as a visiting professor under a joint grant from the Emergency Committee of
Displaced German Scholars and the Rockefeller Foundation. The head of Penn’s
graduate program in mathematics at the time, J. R. Kline, certainly knew the
visitor’s worth. In 1936 Kline convinced Penn authorities to offer Rademacher an
assistant professorship and tenure. Rademacher accepted, and he ultimately
stayed at Penn until retirement in 1962, having been promoted to full professor in
1939.
</p>
<p>
Rademacher’s personal life was not without turmoil, as he married for the
third time in 1949. But the third time was a charm, his wife being Irma
Schoenberg Wolpe, the sister of his well-known colleague Isaac J. Schoenberg, a
faculty member at Penn from 1941 to 1966.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Rademacher was a member of the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton during 1953 and for the academic year 1960-1961. He also
spent 1954-1955 in Bombay, India, as a Guggenheim Fellow at the Tata Institute
for Fundamental Research.
</p>
<p>
During his 28-year stint at Penn Rademacher directed 17 doctoral
dissertations, more than anyone else at Penn except for J. R. Kline, who directed
19. (He directed four dissertations in Germany before emigrating.) Rademacher’s
students have also played significant roles in two EPADEL institutions in
Philadelphia. His 1959 graduate, Father Frederick Homann, became an institution
at St. Joseph’s University. But Rademacher’s most enduring influence has been
on Temple University, where his 1951 graduate, Albert Schild, initiated
Temple’s Ph.D. program in 1967 and lured another Rademacher student, Emil
Grosswald, from a professorship at Penn in West Philadelphia to Temple in
North Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
Forced retirement from Penn at age 70 did not mean the end of mathematical
activity for the indefatigable Rademacher. He joined several other notable
immigrants as a visiting professor at the Courant Institute in New York 1962-
1964, after which he moved to the Rockefeller University as a visiting professor
1964-1966 and an affiliate from 1966 until his death three years later. The
University of Pennsylvania memorialized Rademacher’s name with a prestigious
lecture series that began in 1978 with talks by Marcel Schutzenberger, I. M.
Singer, and John Tate, and has numbered several Fields Medallists since then.

  <title>Profile: James Alexander Shohat (1886-1944)</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Shohat, James Alexander (1886-1944)</h></idx>
<p>
James A. Shohat (show-hot) was one of several émigrés to settle in the
Philadelphia area. Born in Brest-Litovsk, Russia, on November 18, 1886, he
earned two degrees from the University of Petrograd (now St. Petersburg). The
first, an equivalent of our bachelors degree, was awarded in 1910. Shohat was a
Fellow there from 1912 to 1916, and from 1913 to 1917 he was an instructor at
the Polytechnic Institute of Petrograd. The next year he was an instructor at the
Mining Institute of Petrograd. Then he accepted a professorship at Ural
University in Ekatherineburg, where he remained until 1921, when he returned to
Petrograd as a professor at the Pedagogical Institute. He was awarded the degree
of Magister of Pure Mathematics, the equivalent of our Ph.D., in 1922.
</p>
<p>
Shohat came to the United States the following year. After spending 1923-
1924 as an assistant at the University of Chicago, he moved to the University of
Michigan as an assistant professor, a post he held until 1929. Although he
became a naturalized citizen that year, he moved to Paris for one year to conduct
research at the Institut Henri Poincaré.
</p>
<p>
James Shohat came to the Philadelphia area in 1930 when J. R. Kline, the
head of the department at the University of Pennsylvania, hired him as a lecturer.
That fall Shohat delivered an invited lecture at the annual meeting of the
Philadelphia Section. The following year he was promoted to assistant professor
at Penn, where he spent the rest of his career, being promoted to associate
professor in 1935 and professor in 1942.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the 1930s Shohat delivered four invited talks to the Philadelphia
Section. He also presented two invited <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> lectures, in September 1934 in
Williamstown and in April 1936 in New York. The first was titled, <q>On the
expansion of functions in series of orthogonal polynomials</q> and the second <q>The
characterization of a distribution function through its moments</q>. He was the only
invited speaker at the annual 1934 summer meeting of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> held at Williams
College.
</p>
<p>
Shohat published numerous important memoirs and one book (written with J.
D. Tamarkin) on orthogonal polynomials. He wrote several in French for
Comptes Revues and Russian for Matematica Sbornik, reviewed many articles for
Zentralblatt, and translated works from Russian. He served as an associate editor
for the Duke Mathematical Journal since its inception in 1935; he was also an
associate editor for the <em>Bulletin of the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url></em>.
</p>
<p>
Shohat resided on Eagle Road in the Manoa section of Upper Darby. He was a
member of the Orthodox Greek Church there.
</p>
<p>
In July 1944 Shohat came down with a case of pneumonia that developed
heart problems that caused his death on October 8, 1944, at age 57. He was
survived by his wife of 22 years, Nadiashda Galli-Shohat, who had received her
Ph.D. in physics from Göttingen in 1914 and who had taught at Bryn Mawr as
well as several other colleges.
