  <title>EPADEL, 1979-2000</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref> described the period of transition in which the local section of the
      MAA evolved from the Philadelphia Section to EPADEL, the Eastern
      Pennsylvania and Delaware Section. The name change that officially took
      place in 1979 was more than cosmetic because it reflected a geographic reality
      that existed since the formation of the New Jersey Section in 1956. Nonetheless,
      the section lost the distinction of being the only one named after a city. We have
      seen that from 1956 to 1978 the character of the section changed from one
      devoted almost exclusively to the development of mathematics to one that
      sponsored a variety of activities on pedagogical and curricular themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter discusses the modern phase of the section, from the time its name
      change was approved on January 2, 1979, up to the dawn of the third millennium.
      The chapter begins with an examination of the annual meetings held during the
      22-year period. No attempt is made to analyze attendance figures because they
      were reported only sporadically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next part of the chapter describes the major sectional initiatives carried
      out during this period. Unlike before, the account is not based on secretaries’
      reports from the Monthly because at first the reports merely listed elected officers
      and invited lectures, but then those reports disappeared from the Monthly
      altogether. Instead, the account here is mostly gleaned from files archived in the
      section’s records and from newsletters. Even though the range of sectional
      activities broadened initially, our brief chronicle provides evidence of a
      membership strongly committed to numerous and diverse initiatives. We describe
      these activities in four broad categories: students (student paper competitions,
      student chapters, visiting lecture series), professional development (Special
      Interest Groups, MAA representatives/liaisons, promotion of the cause of female
      mathematicians, promotion of the cause of underrepresented groups, Project
      NExT, a professional chapter), education (workshops, distinguished teaching
      award, contributed papers), and public policy (public information officers,
      newspaper articles).
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of sectional activities is followed by a brief look at leaders who
      shaped those activities over the past 22 years. We provide brief sketches of all
      presidents, secretary-treasurers, and governors, as well as a few other selected
      individuals who contributed in vital ways. One president, Marvin Brubaker, is
      profiled at the end of the chapter to honor his many contributions to the section
      and the national MAA. We also analyze the academic affiliations of the elected
      officers. Although we examine membership on the Executive Committee, we
      provide sketches of only two members who were not elected to other positions of
      leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last part of the chapter analyzes the programs from meetings held at the
      annual fall meetings during the EPADEL period. The chapter ends with a
      categorical analysis of the content of the invited lectures. <xref ref="SpringMeetings">Chapter</xref> analyzes
      spring meetings held during this period.

  </introduction>
  <section>
    <title>Annual Meetings</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Table18">Table</xref> provides an overview of EPADEL’s 22 annual fall meetings held
      from 1979 to 2000. Unlike the analogous tables in earlier chapters, there is no
      column providing references to the official annual reports from the Monthly
      because of changes that took place in the journal. Starting in 1981, section
      reports were moved from a Monthly column called <q>Mathematical Association of
      America</q> to a new Center Section of the journal. But that policy lasted only four
      years. In 1986 the Center Section no longer carried section reports, only
      telegraphic reviews. Even the Center Section disappeared the next year. In short,
      section reports were not made public after 1985. The interested reader might
      consult the Monthly for reports on meetings held from 1979 to 1984, yet we
      hasten to add that these reports listed only elected officers and invited addresses.
      To compound matters, the report of the 1979 meeting at Drexel appears twice,
      the one from the 1978 meeting never appeared at all, and the journal’s index is
      unreliable. Even attendance was reported sporadically, often carrying the
      qualifier <q>approximately</q>, although in general, attendance figures were in line
      with those reported from meetings held in the 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the founding of the section in 1926 until 1962 all annual meetings were
      held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. The resulting shift to the Saturday
      before Thanksgiving in 1963 caused a dramatic increase in attendance. As <xref ref="Table18">Table</xref> indicates, this tradition changed in 1989, when an earlier date was established.
      The present policy of holding annual fall meetings on the first Saturday in
      November has been in effect for every meeting since 1994, except for the 1996
      gathering at Delaware State University.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other fall meeting was held in October, but it is not included in <xref ref="Table18">Table</xref>
      because it was not the annual fall meeting. On October 13, 1990, the section
      sponsored a special program at the Community College of Philadelphia. We will
      discuss this meeting later in the context of other sectional activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dates in <xref ref="Table18"> Table</xref> obscure one other attempt the section made to
      accommodate its members. The meeting at Drexel on November 23, 1986, was
      held on a Sunday at the request of several Jewish members who were unable to
      attend meetings held on Saturdays. Minutes from the Executive Committee
      meeting the following February state, <q>The attendance (145) was satisfactory and
      members do not in general oppose having Sunday meetings in the future.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second column in <xref ref="Table18">Table</xref> lists the locations of the 22 annual fall
      meetings, which were held at 17 different institutions. Drexel University and the
      Penn State campus in Montgomery County (which underwent a name change
      recently) hosted three meetings each. Since the section’s founding in 1926,
      Drexel has hosted seven fall meetings, with at least one in each decade since the
      first one in 1953. (The meeting held there in 1991 coincided with the university’s
      100 th anniversary.) It is a completely different story for the Penn State campus,
      formerly Ogontz, now Abington. The section only met there in the present
      period, and one person deserves the lion’s share of the credit. (The meeting there
      in 2000 coincided with the branch campus’s 50 th anniversary. Those who
      attended were given commemorative T-shirts.)

          <term>Ayoub Barsoum Ayoub</term> was born in Cairo, Egypt, where he received his
          B.Sc. in 1951 at Ain-Shams University. He taught high-school mathematics
          in Cairo from 1951 to 1955, when he accepted an instructorship at his alma
          mater. He came to the U.S. in 1975 and enrolled in the graduate program at
          Temple University, receiving an M.A. in 1977 and a Ph.D. in 1980. His
          dissertation on units in prime cyclotomic fields was written under the
          supervision of sectional governor Emil Grosswald. Upon graduation, Ayoub
          returned to Ain-Shams for two years, directing one masters thesis while
          there. A naturalized citizen, he returned to the U.S. as a visiting professor at
          Temple. He has been at the Penn State - Abington since 1983, serving as
          coordinator of the mathematics program 1991-1993. He has won several
          teaching prizes, including Penn State’s Atherton Award for Excellence in
          Teaching in 1990. Conversely, he endowed the Student Mathematics Achievement Award on the Penn State campus. Ayoub served on
          EPADEL’s Executive Committee 1991-1994 and headed up the section’s
          Undergraduate Paper Competition 1993-1997.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      The only other institution that was the site for more than one meeting in the
      22-year period is the University of Delaware, which hosted meetings in 1980 and
      1990. This makes five times in the history of the section that an annual fall
      meeting was held in Newark. The 1990 meeting was historic; over lunch, Willard
      Baxter presented a short history of the section. Besides, the day began with a
      welcome by university president, and former mathematics professor, David P.
      Roselle, yet another instance of Delaware mathematicians holding top
      administrative positions. Recall from <xref ref="Establishment">Chapter</xref> that G. A. Harter, Delaware
      president 1896-1914, was an active member of the section from its inception in
      1926.
    </p>
    <p>
      That leaves 14 different institutions that hosted the remaining 14 meetings, a
      reflection of the broadening of active participation throughout the section. It is
      notable that the two institutions that had dominated the sites of earlier meetings,
      the University of Pennsylvania and Lehigh University, hosted consecutive
      meetings toward the end of the EPADEL period after long interludes. The 1997
      meeting at Penn was the first held there in 42 years, while the 1998 meeting at
      Lehigh was the first in 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, Penn has hosted 16 fall meetings, the most of any institution in the
      section. Next comes Drexel with seven, followed by Lehigh and Swarthmore
      with six each, including the meeting at Swarthmore College in 1984.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we provide information on the remaining 12 institutions that hosted one
      meeting during the EPADEL period. The 1982 meeting at West Chester
      University and the 1987 meeting at Franklin &amp; Marshall College were the third
      hosted by each institution; West Chester hosted earlier meetings in 1965 and
      1970, while F&amp;M hosted meetings in 1962 and 1975. Five schools hosted their
      second meeting: Villanova University in 1981 (the first was in 1966), Bryn Mawr
      College in 1983 (1947), Millersville University in 1989 (1978), Muhlenberg
      College in 1992 (1956), and Montgomery County Community College in 1994
      (1976). The four remaining meetings were held at institutions hosting a fall
      meeting for the only time in the section’s history: Temple University in 1985,
      Cedar Crest College in 1993, Delaware State University in 1996, and, to
      celebrate the school’s 100 th anniversary, Elizabethtown College in 1999. The
      meeting at Delaware State marked the only time the section met at one of its
      three historically black institutions; none has been held at Lincoln University or
      Cheyney University so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data here refer to annual fall meetings. The section began to sponsor
      annual spring meetings in 1976 but we consider them separately in the next
      chapter. Also, the Community College of Philadelphia hosted a meeting in
      October 1990 but it was a special meeting, not the annual meeting. CCP thus
      became the second community college to host a meeting sponsored by the
      section.

  <section><title>Activities</title>
  <p>
    The broadening of sectional activities that began in the period of expansion,
    1956-1978, intensified and widened even further during the EPADEL years. As
    usual, the program of invited lectures provided the centerpiece for the section’s
    activities, but several endeavors that had been initiated in the period of expansion
    were continued while several new ones emerged. President Nancy Hagelgans
    summarized the section’s underlying twin goals in her 1993 message reviewing
    ten years of volunteer service: <q>These meetings were designed for faculty
    members to further undergraduate mathematics education and to provide
    interesting mathematical talks.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    We begin our look at sectional activities from 1979 to 2000 by discussing the
    major ways in which the membership furthered the cause of undergraduate
    education. In one of her two governor’s messages from 1996, Hagelgans noted
    that the MAA’s mission was served by its Web site in four different areas:
    education, professional development, students, and public policy. These four
    areas provide a useful tool for summarizing all sectional activities.
  </p>
  <p><foreign>Students</foreign></p>
  <p>
    In 1986 Anthony Hughes (then at Villanova) announced the initiation of a
    new sectional activity aimed at involving more undergraduate students in its
    programs. He wrote, <q>EPADEL is sponsoring a Student Paper Competition.
    Undergraduates are invited to submit papers in any area of the mathematical
    sciences. Winners will receive a one-year membership in the MAA.</q> There was
    no further mention of the competition until 1990, when Richard Grassl
    (Muhlenberg) took over. Grassl announced that the prize was raised to $100, an
    amount that would remain constant until 1998, when it was doubled. Six years
    earlier the name of the competition was changed to the Student Mathematical
    Papers Prize Competition, which it remains today. There have been four
    subsequent directors of the program: Nancy Hagelgans of Ursinus (1991), Walter
    Stromquist (Daniel Wagner’s) (1992-1993), and two members from Penn State –
    Abington: Ayoub Ayoub (1994-1997) and Lothar Redlin (1997-2000). Winners
    of the competition have been announced sporadically in the newsletters.
  </p>
  <p>
    In January 1989 the national MAA inaugurated a program of student chapters
    that has proved to be immensely successful in our section. The official
    notification read, <q>The Board of Governors of the MAA has approved a plan to
    develop Student Chapters for the purpose of attracting students to careers in the
    mathematical sciences. MAA Student Chapters will be formed at individual
    institutions, and the members of the Student Chapters will be regarded as
    members of the MAA section associated with their institution.</q> The MAA
    envisaged chapter activities to include films, speakers, mini-courses, and career
    information. Our section served as a model for others right from the start. No
    wonder – the national coordinator of the program was Howard Anton (then at
    Drexel), the former EPADEL president.

    The first coordinator of EPADEL Student Chapters was Nancy Baxter
    (Dickinson College), who initially found our section’s response to Anton’s call
    discouraging. After a few months in office she pleaded with the membership,
    <q>It’s time to organize an MAA Student Chapter at your institution! ... At this
    point only one school in the EPADEL section has requested application materials
    from the MAA office.</q> Baxter did not identify that school, though she suspects it
    was Kutztown. In a private correspondence, she wrote, <q>Deb Frantz was so gung-
    ho that I passed the torch to her. She was excited and enthusiastic. She organized
    the first student paper sessions and brought her students to the meetings – she set
    a great example for the rest of us to follow.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although Kutztown’s indefatigable Deborah Frantz became the EPADEL
    coordinator one year later, she recalls that Albright was the first school to request
    information from Baxter. Nonetheless, the new coordinator was soon boasting
    that our section sponsored 10 of the 160 nationwide sections. (EPADEL is the
    13 th largest of the 29 sections.) Moreover, Frantz manned a student-chapters table
    at our section’s spring 1990 meeting and arranged for a program of 10-minute
    talks to run in a parallel session in the afternoon. When asked how she became
    involved in student chapters, she replied, <q>In the spring of 1990 the national
    MAA Committee on Student Chapters was in its infancy and I got a call from
    then-chair Howard Anton asking if I’d be willing to write a newsletter for the
    newly-created Student Chapters. The idea was that I’d write a first issue and then
    serve as editor of the newsletter once things caught on. As newsletter ‘editor’, I
    served on the National MAA Committee on Student Chapters for about seven
    years. This entailed not only the compilation of newsletters twice each year, but
    also attending the National Joint Meetings and helping to develop the newly-
    created Student Chapters.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly EPADEL student chapters were in enthusiastic and energetic hands.
    The number of chapters in the section grew to 20 in 1991 and leveled out at 24
    by 1996. Throughout the 1990s students were kept abreast of competitions
    (Putnam, Modeling, and Problem-Solving in addition to our own section’s
    contest), opportunities for involvement at the two annual MAA meetings, Pi Mu
    Epsilon meetings, the magazine Math Horizons, and the NSF program in
    Research Experiences for Undergraduates. In addition to these activities, Deb
    Frantz initiated a series of biennial conferences called <q>Careers in Mathematics</q>,
    which have met at Kutztown (in 1991), Lebanon Valley (1993), Messiah (1995),
    Millersville (1997), and East Stroudsburg (1999). Those conferences garnered
    national interest as early as 1991. EPADEL President David Hill wrote, <q>The
    ‘Careers in Mathematics’ student conference coordinated by Deborah Frantz was
    an outstanding success and generated national interest.</q> Inspired by the success
    of this endeavor, Douglas Ensley initiated a series of annual Student Mathematics
    Conferences at his home institution, Shippensburg, in 1996. After a decade of
    excellent leadership, Frantz handed the mantle of leadership to Alicia Sevilla
    (Moravian) in the year 2000.

        <term>Deborah A. Frantz </term> is a native of Reading, PA. She earned a B.S. degree in
        mathematics and computer science (with teacher certification in
        mathematics) at Saint Joseph’s College (Rensselaer, IN) in 1977. Then she
        entered the graduate program at Lehigh, earning an M.S. in 1981 and a
        h.D. three years later. Her dissertation on summability methods,
        probability distributions, and linear operators was written under EPADEL
        governor Jerry King. Frantz spent the year 1981-1982 as a visiting instructor
        at Moravian. Upon receiving her doctorate she accepted an assistant
        professorship at Western Kentucky, where she stayed for two years. She
        then returned to Lehigh, spending the year 1986-1987 as an adjunct assistant
        professor. In 1987 she moved to Kutztown University, where she has
        remained since then.

<p>
    As noted in <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref>, student talks made their way onto the program for the
    first time in 1962 but they occurred only irregularly after that. However, these
    student talks became a staple at both the fall and spring meetings under Deb
    Frantz and they have continued under Linda Thiel (Ursinus and SIAM), who
    assumed the coordinator position for student talks in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
    The program of visiting lecturers has run continuously since it was directed by
    Jerry King (Lehigh) in 1974. Within two years King produced a list of 20
    members who agreed to speak at nearby schools. He was succeeded by Charles
    G. Denlinger (Millersville). By 1979 the program had a new chairperson, Bruce
    Babcock (Penn State – York) and a formal name, the Visiting Lecture Program.
    Three years later there was a new chairperson, Marialuisa McAllister (Moravian),
    and a slightly expanded name, Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program. In her
    call for additional members McAllister wrote that she was looking for volunteers
    who <q>have interesting topics or special expertise to share with colleagues within
    the section (either as a lecturer or as a consultant) and are willing to forgo the
    usual honoraria.</q> She noted too that the Program was aimed to complement the
    national MAA Program of Visiting Lecturers and Consultants on a regional scale.
    The Newsletter for the annual fall meeting in 1983 is almost entirely taken up
    with the complete list of speakers in the Program, some 16 in all. Chairpersons
    who succeeded McAllister (with the year of first mention in the sectional
    newsletter) are JoAnne Growney of Bloomsburg (1986), Nancy Hagelgans of
    Ursinus (1987), Growney again (1990), Louise Berard of Wilkes (1992), and
    Douglas Ensley of Shippensburg (1995). Berard reported 23 members on her list
    in 1994 and Ensley increased that total to 25 in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
    An activity of a different type occurred at the luncheon during the annual
    1993 meeting when JoAnne Growney gave a public reading titled <q>Mathematics
    in poetry</q>. This endeavor reflected a humanistic approach to mathematics that
    was beginning to take hold nationally at that time.
  </p>
  <p><foreign>Professional Development</foreign></p>
  <p>
    The idea to form Special Interest Groups (SIGs) appeared for the first time at
    the annual fall meeting in 1980 when forms were distributed for members to
    declare their areas of special interest. By the next spring meeting Marialuisa
    McAllister declared, <q>EPADEL proudly announces the birth of its first SIG –
    Mathematical modeling and applications in mathematics.</q> At the fall meeting
    that year an hour was set aside for the SIGs to organize themselves. At that time
    Carl Leinbach of Gettysburg was appointed SIG Chairman. The newsletter for
    the 1982 meeting listed nine SIGs and their membership: computing and
    modeling, logic and foundations, mathematics anxiety, student programs,
    mathematics and statistics education, graduate school and job opportunity, linear
    programming, public policy on mathematical sciences, and the history of
    mathematics. Two years later Marialuisa McAllister took the reins again and
    distributed forms for new groups and new members. Her new list added several
    new groups: mathematical programming, graph theory/networks/combinatorics,
    student programs, and statistics. In 1986 that list expanded to include two new
    special interest groups: the monster simple group, and statistics/operations
    research. Apparently interest in SIGs dissipated quickly, because no sectional
    documents mention them after that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the issues central to the success of SIGs was communication. In an
    effort to improve overall communication with the entire membership the national
    MAA office initiated a program of Institutional MAA Representatives in 1977.
    These volunteers distributed MAA material to colleagues, encouraged the
    participation of members in sectional and national activities, and recruited new
    members. The newsletter from the fall 1988 meeting lists EPADEL
    representatives from 76 different institutions. A decade later the MAA changed
    from an unstructured set of representatives to an integrated program of liaisons
    with essentially the same charge and under the leadership of the section’s
    governor.
  </p>
  <p>
    EPADEL played an active role in promoting the professional development of
    women and minorities. The Philadelphia Region of Women and Mathematics
    (WAM) has been coordinated since 1986 primarily by Gloria Dion (at Penn State
    – Ogontz and the Educational Testing Service). The major aim of WAM, initially
    funded by an IBM grant, was to encourage girls to continue their study of
    mathematics throughout high school by providing speakers who worked in fields
    that used mathematics or statistics. Along these lines it should be mentioned that
    Regina Brunner (Cedar Crest College) conducted a series of annual MathConns
    at her home institution throughout the 1990s to celebrate Mathematics Awareness
    Day for seventh- and eighth-grade girls and their teachers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The year 1990 was a banner year for sectional activities aimed at increasing
    minority representation in mathematics. First a lunch table was set-aside at the
    annual spring meeting <q>for anyone who would like to discuss ways of drawing
    more minority students into mathematics.</q> This gathering generated a special
    EPADEL meeting held under the leadership of Joanne Darken at Community
    College of Philadelphia on October 13. Titled <q>Underrepresented groups in
    mathematics: Overcoming the obstacles</q>, the program began with a morning
    session featuring two stellar speakers, Johnny Houston and Uri Treisman. The
    afternoon session consisted of two one-hour panel discussions, <q>Filters in the
    pipeline</q>, moderated by Joan Countryman (Germantown Friends School), and
    <q>Pumps in the pipeline</q>, moderated by Marvin Brubaker (Messiah College). The
    meeting’s success generated interest at the national MAA meeting the next year,
    as reflected by an article in the Association’s journal Focus. EPADEL then
    sponsored a workshop conducted by Uri Treisman at Swarthmore on October 27,
    1991, on programs designed to improve minority participation and performance
    in college-level mathematics courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the middle of the last decade the section began participating in Project
    NExT, a national program aimed at helping graduate students (in the last two
    years of their doctoral program) and new professors (in their first three years) get
    acclimated to New Experiences in Teaching college mathematics. In 1994
    section governor Marvin Brubaker reported that five of the 66 participants came
    from EPADEL. Two years later section governor Nancy Hagelgans reported that
    the four EPADEL participants kept in touch via e-mail. In 1998 EPADEL
    president Kay Somers hosted a breakfast for the seven sectional participants
    before the annual fall meeting at Lehigh.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all endeavors are as successful as those mentioned above. In 1992 Jerry
    Porter (Penn) asked if it was time for the formation of a professional chapter
    intended to meet the needs of the section’s nonacademic members. So Walter
    Stromquist (then at Daniel Wagner Associates) and Porter arranged a dinner that
    May at which 18 people heard a lecture by Herbert S. Wilf on efficient sorting
    algorithms. A second dinner meeting was held that November at which Brent
    Morris spoke about computer science and magic. However, the meetings were
    poorly attended – only eight were present at the second one – and the effort did
    not continue past that point in spite of a $500 grant to support it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another development that never came to fruition was a sectional database.
    The use of, and need for, a means of maintaining information about the
    membership was discussed at Executive Committee meetings throughout the
    early 1980s. However, by 1986 it was decided to table the issue because the
    national MAA maintained its own database that would satisfy the section’s
    needs.
  </p>
  <p><foreign>Education</foreign></p>
  <p>
    The workshop to improve minority participation and performance, sponsored
    by the section in 1990, was one of many conducted under EPADEL’s aegis to
    enhance faculty development. Most of these workshops have been held during
    summer sessions at Messiah College under the direction of Marvin Brubaker.
    <xref ref="Table19"> Table</xref> (on the next page) lists some of the Messiah workshops taught by
    EPADEL members.
  </p>
  <p>
    EPADEL was also involved in several other workshops, including those
    devoted to the history of mathematics, run by Paul Wolfson of West Chester, and
    those devoted to using calculators in mathematics courses, run by Roseanne
    Hofmann of Montgomery County Community College.

    In <m>1991</m> the MAA announced the initiation of a program of awards for
    outstanding teaching. Formally called the Award for Distinguished College or
    University Teaching of Mathematics, each section could elect one winner, and
    that winner automatically became a nominee for one of at most three annual
    national awards (except the first year, when seven were awarded). Of course
    EPADEL participated in this program right away, naming a Selection Committee
    headed by David Rosen (retired from Swarthmore). The first winner was
    announced at the 1992 annual spring meeting. <xref ref="Table20"> Table</xref> lists the winners to date.
    Initially the award included a framed certificate and a donation to the recipient’s
    college for the purchase of library materials in the mathematical sciences.
    Beginning in 1997, however, funding from the Goodville Mutual Casualty
    Company allocated $500 to the recipient and $500 to the recipient’s library.

  <p><foreign>Public Policy</foreign></p>
  <p>
    In 1979 the MAA hired a part-time publicity specialist for the first time. By
    the mid 1980s some national leaders felt that a local version might be a valuable
    asset to the sections as well. Toward the latter part of the 1980s the section
    attempted to increase public awareness of mathematics in two different ways.
    First, in 1987 the section created a new position, Public Information Officer, to
    promote sectional activities. The three PIOs to date have been David Zitarelli
    (Temple) 1987-1992, Regina Brunner (Cedar Crest) 1992-1999, and Cheryl
    Olsen (Shippensburg).
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, in 1993 James Crawford (Lafayette) attempted to promote local
    mathematical developments from a different vantage point – maintaining a
    <q>Mathematics in the news</q> bulletin board at annual fall meetings. He announced,
    <q>Issues of mathematics and mathematics education appear from time to time in
    newspaper articles which we clip and post on our bulletin boards and office doors
    ... At the fall meeting we plan to have a bulletin board emphasizing news items
    from Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware.</q> Crawford maintained the bulletin
    board at two fall meetings but an apparent lack of interest in his novel program
    caused him to drop the idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    The section has been more successful in maintaining communication with its
    members in two different ways. Beginning in 1990 the newsletters included the
    e-mail addresses of those section officers who maintained e-mail accounts. Four
    years later the section announced, <q>EPADEL goes Electronic,</q> meaning that the
    section’s newsletters could be sent to members by e-mail. The announcement
    also notified the members of the MAA’s fledgling Gopher server and the
    intended link from it to the section’s Gopher server. In 1996 president Louise
    Berard (Wilkes) announced the completion of the section’s Web page,
    maintained at the University of Pennsylvania by Dennis DeTurck, and its link to
    the national MAA Web page at <url href="http://www.maa.org/">http://www.maa.org/</url>.
  </p>

  <title>Leaders</title>
  <p>
    Sectional leadership expanded and broadened throughout the EPADEL
    period. Initially, the ten-member Executive Committee – three officers, the
    section governor, and six members elected at large – planned and implemented
    all of the section’s activities. Toward the end of the preceding period, the
    newsletter editor joined the committee ex-officio. Membership burgeoned after
    that. From 1982 through 1987 the SIG chairman became an ex-officio member.
    So did the public information officer in 1989. The next year, the coordinators of
    three programs also came aboard in the same capacity – student chapters,
    workshops and special events, and visiting lecturer and consultant program.
    Finally, beginning in 1994, the publisher’s liaison was added to the roll. The
    tradition of the newsletter editor, PIO, coordinator of student clubs, and
    publisher’s liaison serving as ex-officio members of the Executive Committee
    continues today. Although the by-laws permit voting only by elected officials,
    the Committee has found that over the years a consensus is reached, so formal
    votes are rarely taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another persisting tradition is that any officer of the national MAA or editor
    of an MAA journal becomes an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee.
    In the present period, Doris Schattschneider served on the Executive Committee
    1980-1985 for her role as editor of Mathematics Magazine and 1994-1996 as first
    vice president of the national MAA. Gerald Porter joined the Committee in 1989
    when he was elected governor-at-large of the MAA. The next year he joined the
    MAA’s Finance Committee and three years later was elected treasurer of the
    national Association. Schattschneider was profiled in <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref>; Porter is
    profiled in <xref ref="SpringMeetings">Chapter</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="Table21">Table</xref> lists the section’s officials who were elected from 1979 to 2000. Even
    though all positions of leadership remained the same as they had been since the
    dramatic revision of 1968, we now include section governors on the list since
    they began to assume leadership roles in the middle of the preceding period.
    Although we do not list members elected to three-year terms on the Executive
    Committee, we describe some of their efforts below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The header in  <xref ref="Table21">Table</xref> indicates a slight change in the titles of the section’s
    officers during the EPADEL period. At the business meeting held during the
    lunch hour at the spring meeting in April 1979, the section’s chair Doris
    Schattschneider <q>appointed Will Baxter and Herb Wilf to prepare changes in the
    Bylaws to make them ‘unisex’.</q> At the meeting in November 1979 the section’s
    membership voted to affect those changes; since then <q>president</q> replaced all
    former references to <q>chairperson</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall our convention that the year <m>1999</m> in the penultimate row of <xref ref="Table21">Table</xref>
    refers to the November meeting at which Douglas Ensley (Shippensburg) was
    elected president of the section even though he carried out most of his duties in
    the year 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
    The section derived great benefits from a cadre of leaders during
    this <m>22</m>-year period, including <m>11</m> different
    presidents, one additional vice-president, three additional
    secretary-treasurers, and four additional section governors. These
    19 officers were affiliated with 15 different institutions, with
    only Drexel, Gettysburg, Moravian, and Wilkes being home to more
    than one office holder.  The officers represent a wide geographic
    area, ranging from Wilkes (Wong and Berard) in the north to
    Delaware (Baxter) in the south, and from Lehigh (King) in the east
    to Shippensburg (Ensley) in the west.

  <p><foreign>Presidents</foreign></p>
  <p>
    The section boasted 11 different presidents in the 22-year EPADEL period.
    Although the by-laws prohibit more than two consecutive terms, no president has
    served two nonconsecutive terms. This feature is clearly seen in  <xref ref="Table21">Table</xref>. Equally
    evident is the tradition of the vice-president serving a two-year term before
    ascending to a two-year presidency.
  </p>
  <p>
    The presidents represent a diverse lot in various respects. Walter Stromquist
    was only the second officer in the section’s 75-year history to hold a
    nonacademic affiliation. (Ed Block was first, in 1957-1958.) The 10 presidents
    with academic affiliation came from eight different schools. Howard Anton and
    Bernard Kolman continued the line of six different presidents from Drexel
    University that began with James E. Davis in 1942. Wilkes College was the only
    other institution to boast two different presidents in the EPADEL period; Bing
    Wong and Louise Berard are the only two officers (in any capacity) ever
    affiliated with Wilkes in the section’s history. Nancy Hagelgans was the third
    president to come from Ursinus College, having been preceded by John Clawson
    in 1935 and Frank Manning in 1951. Two presidents were the second to come
    from their home institution: Kay Somers (Moravian College) was preceded by
    Doris Schattschneider by 20 years, while David Hill (Temple University) was
    preceded by Walter Lawton by 30 years. The remaining three presidents were the
    only ones to ever represent their institution in this office: David Flesner
    (Gettysburg College), Marvin Brubaker (Messiah College), and Douglas Ensley
    (Shippensburg University.) Contrary to the section’s earlier history, no president
    in the EPADEL period came from the four institutions that produced the most
    presidents up to 1979: the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University,
    Swarthmore College, and the University of Delaware.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike the period 1956-1978, when 38% of the section’s chairs received their
    doctorates at Penn, in the present period only Bernard Kolman did (9%).
    Similarly, whereas 77% of the chairs received their doctorate from Ivy League
    institutions in the earlier period, only three (Stromquist, Berard, and Kolman) of
    the 11 did so in the present period (27%).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before proceeding we pause to emphasize a point made in <xref ref="Emigres">Chapter</xref>: the last
    decade of the <m>20</m>th century was a period of female leadership of the section.  <xref ref="Table21">Table</xref> reveals that Nancy Hagelgans, Louise Berard, and Kay Somers held office in
    six of the 10 years. These leaders follow in the pioneering footsteps of Anna Pell
    Wheeler (1943-1944), Marguerite Lehr (1958-1959), and Doris Schattschneider
    (1977-1979).
  </p>
  <p>
    We provide sketches of all presidents (in the order of their terms) except

    <li><term>Howard Anton</term> is a native Philadelphian who received his higher education
    at three different institutions, receiving a B.A. at Lehigh (1960), M.A. at
    Illinois (1963), and Ph.D. at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (1968).
    Anton worked as a mathematician at Burroughs Corporation after receiving
    his undergraduate degree. His first academic position was at Hunter College,
    where he taught from 1964 to 1966. Anton came to Drexel University
    immediately after receiving his doctorate in 1968. He remained there until
    1983, when he left to form Anton Textbooks, Inc., an enterprise spawned by
    his many successful textbooks.

    <li><term>Bing Kuen Wong</term> was born in Shanghai, China, and received his higher
    education in the U.S. After receiving his A.B. at Pittsburgh State (Kansas) in
    1961 he entered the graduate program at the University of Illinois, obtaining
    an M.A. in 1963 and a Ph.D. in 1966. His doctoral dissertation on dynamical
    systems was written under Waldemar Trjitzinsky. Wong held assistant
    professorships at two institutions before arriving at Wilkes College (now
    Wilkes University) in 1968 as a professor. He has remained there ever since,
    serving as department chair twice (1968-1984 and 1990-1992) and as the
    associate dean of the School of Science and Engineering from 1992 to 1996.
    </li>
    <li><term>David Edwin Flesner</term> was born in Indiana. He received his A.B. at
    Wittenberg University in 1966 before enrolling in the graduate program at
    the University of Michigan, where he obtained an A.M. (1968) and Ph.D.
    (1971). His dissertation – on maximal subgroups of four-dimensional
    symplectic groups in characteristic two – was written under Jack E.
    McLaughlin. Upon receiving his doctorate, Flesner came to Gettysburg
    College and has remained there ever since. He became chair of the
    department in 1999. His book Aging and the Aged: Problems,
    Opportunities, Challenges (edited with Edwin D. Freed) was published in
    1980. For several years after that he directed an interdepartmental senior
    honors Seminar on Aging and the Aged. He also took part in a project at
    Maryland involving applications of group theory in chemistry and physics.
    In 2000, Flesner completed a toolbar package to implement the Klein model
    of hyperbolic geometry within the Cabri Geometry software.
    </li>
    <li><term>Bernard Kolman</term> was born in Havana, Cuba, and became a naturalized
    citizen in 1953. He received all of his higher education in the U.S., earning a
    B.S. <foreign>summa cum laude</foreign> from Brooklyn College in 1954 and an Sc. M. from
    Brown University two years later. From 1957 to 1964 he was a principal
    mathematician at the UNIVAC Division of Sperry Rand Corporation.
    Meanwhile he completed his doctoral studies at Penn, and received his
    Ph.D. in 1965 for a dissertation on the lattice of subalgebras of a Lie algebra
    written under Morikuni Goto. Kolman had accepted an assistant
    professorship at Drexel in 1964, and he remained there 34 years until his
    retirement in 1998, having served as department head 1971-1972. During
    that tenure he organized two well-known conferences in Lie algebras and
    edited the proceedings from them. He also directed one Ph.D. student.
    Kolman is the author of numerous textbooks that have been translated into
    several other languages.

    <li xml:id="HillBio"><term>David Ross Hill</term> is a native of Homestead, PA, who received a B.S. degree
    in education from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and an M.A.
    in mathematics from the State University of New York at Buffalo two years
    later. He spent the year 1966-1967 as a computer analyst with Koppers
    Corp. in Pittsburgh before entering the graduate program at the University
    of Pittsburgh, where he received his Ph.D. in 1973. His dissertation on
    numerical solutions of delay differential equations was written under the
    supervision of George D. Byrne. Hill joined the faculty at Pittsburgh as an
    associate instructor during the last two years of graduate school. Upon
    receiving his doctorate he accepted an assistant professorship at Temple
    University, where he has been since, except for a visiting position at the
    College of the Virgin Islands in 1980. During his tenure he directed two
    masters theses. Hill has been a principal investigator on three major grants –
    two from the NSF (one with D. Zitarelli established linear algebra as a lab
    course in 1990) and one from FIPSE (to produce an interactive text for
    linear algebra with G. Porter). In 1988 Hill presented a mini-course on
    MATLAB at the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> summer meeting in Providence, R.I, and in 1995 he
    delivered a one-hour invited address at the annual MAA meeting on
    teaching linear algebra with technology. In addition to talks at the EPADEL
    spring meetings in 1986 and 1995, he has been an invited lecturer in
    Holland, England, and the Czech Republic. He also taught a short course at
    Messiah College sponsored by EPADEL in 1990. His expertise in teaching
    with computers led him to conduct numerous workshops – at the
    Northeastern Section of the MAA in 1994, the MAA MathFest in Seattle in
    1996, and the NSF-sponsored ATLAST Project from 1992 through 1996.
    Hill is the author of several successful textbooks, including three with
    Bernard Kolman. In addition, he was the recipient of a Distinguished
    Teaching Award at Temple in 1996.

    <li><term>Nancy Lineken Hagelgans</term> was born in Burlington, Vermont. She received
    an A.B. from Goucher College in 1956 before entering the graduate program
    at Johns Hopkins, earning an M.A. three years later. Hagelgans taught at
    two Baltimore institutions (Goucher 1967-1968 and Towson State 1967-
    1972) before moving to the EPADEL area. While teaching at Haverford
    from 1975 to 1977 she decided to complete her doctorate at Hopkins. Her
    supervisor, Jean-Pierre Meyer, suggested that James Stasheff of Temple
    might act as her advisor. He did, and Hagelgans completed her dissertation
    on local spaces with three cells as H-spaces in 1977. She spent 1977-1978 at
    Bryn Mawr, all the while searching for a tenure-track position. Since it
    seemed that the only openings involved computer science she completed an
    M.S. in that field at Villanova in 1979. In 1978 Hagelgans landed a tenure-
    track position at Ursinus in both mathematics and computer science. She has
    remained there ever since, except for the year 1986-1987 spent as a visiting
    professor at the University of Delaware. She served as the department chair
    at Ursinus 1988-1992 and resumed that post in January 2001. Hagelgans
    was elected to a three-year term on the EPADEL Executive Committee in
    1986, when she also began coordinating the Consultants and Speakers
    Program. In addition to four years as president and vice president, she was
    elected to a three-year term as governor 1995-1998. She also was an invited
    speaker at the section’s spring meeting in 1996 on one of her specialties,
    cooperative learning in discrete mathematics. Along this line, she is one of
    the authors of the book <pubtitle>A Practical Guide to Cooperative Learning in
    Collegiate Mathematics</pubtitle>, published in 1995 as MAA Notes Number 37.
    Hagelgans has been active in the national MAA in many other ways –
    serving on the Committee on Consultants (1997-1999), the task force on the
    MAA publication <pubtitle>Guidelines for Programs and Departments in
    Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences</pubtitle> (1997-2000), the Professional
    Development Committee (1998-2001), and the Committee on Sections
    (1999-2002). She has also been involved in Project NexT as a mentor since
    1995, as a workshop presenter in 1996, and as a panelist in 1998 and 1999.

    <li><term>Walter Rees Stromquist</term> possesses very strong mathematical genes. His
    father, Walter Kellogg Stromquist (1917-1999), was a nuclear engineer with
    a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Tennessee. WKS worked at the Oak
    Ridge National Laboratory when his son WRS was born. WKS’s uncle, Carl
    Eben Stromquist (1877-1925), received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale
    in 1903 and was on the faculty at Princeton 1903-1909. CES then moved to
    the University of Wyoming, where he remained until ill health forced him to
    resign in 1922. During this time he was a charter member of the MAA in
    1915 and one of the organizing members of the Rocky Mountain Section of
    the MAA two years later.
    EPADEL chair Walter Rees Stromquist received his B.A. from the
    University of Kansas in 1970 before enrolling in the graduate program at
    Harvard, where he earned two degrees – an M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in
    1975. His dissertation on the four-color problem was written under the
    supervision of Andrew Gleason. Stromquist did not restrict himself to
    mathematics during his stay at Harvard, however, electing graduate courses
    in economics and tax law. Thus it is not particularly surprising that his first
    professional experience was with the Office of Tax Analysis in the U.S.
    Treasury, where he worked 1973-1977. In 1979 Stromquist accepted a
    position with Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, ultimately rising to become
    vice president of the company before leaving in 1998 to become an
    independent consultant. During his tenure he was a visiting professor at
    Temple 1987-1988; he also taught as an adjunct professor at Bryn Mawr,
    Eastern College (in economics), George Washington, and West Point (as an
    Army reservist). Stromquist served as a member of the section’s Executive
    Committee 1987-1991 before being elected to stints as vice president and
    president. At the national level, Stromquist was elected MAA Governor at
    Large for Industry and Government in 2000 and served as an associate
    editor of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> <m>1996-2001</m>.

    <li><term>Louise McNertney Berard</term> is a native of Hazleton, PA. She received her
    bachelors degree from King’s College in 1975 and her Ph.D. from Brown
    University five years later. Her dissertation, <q>One-Parameter Families of
    Surfaces with Constant Curvature in Lorentz <m>3</m>-Space</q>, was the second one
    written under the supervision of MAA president Thomas F. Banchoff.
    Berard accepted a position at Wilkes University upon receiving her
    doctorate. She has remained there ever since, serving as chair 1992-1996.
    She received the Carpenter Outstanding Teacher Award at Wilkes in 1988.
    In addition to being elected president and vice president of EPADEL for two
    years each, Berard served as the coordinator of the section’s Visiting
    Lecturer and Consultant Program 1992-1995.

    <li xml:id="SomersBio"><term>Kay Bergstresser Somers</term> is a native of Fountain Hill, PA. After receiving
    her bachelors degree from Ursinus in 1968 she worked for a year as a
    statistical research analyst with the NY State Department of Mental
    Hygiene. Then she enrolled in the graduate program at Rensselaer
    Polytechnic Institute, earning a masters degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. two
    years later. Her dissertation, <q>A generalization of strong unicity</q>, was
    written under the supervision of Harry McLaughlin. Kay Somers then was a
    visiting lecturer at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University before
    accepting an assistant professorship at Lafayette in 1975. She left there in
    1979 to work as an operations research analyst with Air Products and
    Chemicals, Inc. Somers moved to Moravian College in 1981 and has
    remained there ever since, serving as chair 1992-1998. In addition to being
    elected president and vice president of EPADEL, she also served as
    secretary-treasurer for six years. In addition, she was an invited speaker at
    annual meeting of the Michigan Section of the MAA in 1994. At the
    national level, Somers was a member of the MAA Ad Hoc Committee to
    review the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> in <m>1999</m>. Two of her students have won MAA student
    paper contests.

    <li xml:id="EnsleyBio"><term>Douglas Edward Ensley</term> was born in Phenix City, Alabama. After earning
    a B.S. degree from the University of Alabama at Huntsville in 1986, Ensley
    moved north to enroll in the graduate program at Carnegie Mellon
    University. He received an M.S. degree two years later and a Ph.D. in 1993
    for a dissertation on measures on categorical structures written under the
    supervision of Michael Albert. Upon receiving his degree, Ensley moved to
    Shippensburg, where he became a 1993 project NExT fellow. He served as
    assistant chair at Shippensburg 1995-1999. Summers found him back in
    Pittsburgh, however, as the mathematics instructor for the Pennsylvania
    Governor’s School of the Sciences (PGSS) held at Carnegie Mellon. His
    contributions were recognized by the PGSS with an Exemplary Service
    Award in 1996. In addition to serving EPADEL as president and vice
    president, Ensley volunteered in two other capacities, coordinating the
    Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program 1995-1999 and directing (with
    Joanne Darken) Project NExT 2000-2001. In his short career Ensley has
    also been active with the MAA, serving as a Visiting Mathematician during
    the fall of 2000. This led to his being appointed editor of the MAA Digital
    Classroom Resources, a part of the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library.
    Winning a graduate student teaching award at Carnegie Mellon in 1993
    foreshadowed successful teaching at Shippensburg, as three of his students
    have won MAA awards for student paper presentations at two different
    Mathfests.

    <li xml:id="CrannellBio"><term>Annalisa Crannell</term> was born to be an academic, having been delivered to a
    pair of graduate students in physics at the Stanford University Hospital in
    Palo Alto, California. She crossed the country to take her undergraduate
    education in the EPADEL area, earning a bachelors degree Magna Cum
    Laude with honors in mathematics from Bryn Mawr at age 20 in 1986. From
    there Crannell traveled further east to enroll in the graduate program at
    Brown, where she received a masters degree three years later and a Ph.D. in
    1992. Her doctoral dissertation, <q>The existence of many periodic,
    nontraveling solutions to the Boussinesq equation</q>, was written under the
    supervision of Walter Craig. Crannell went directly to Franklin and Marshall
    upon receiving her degree and has remained there since then. She will chair
    the department beginning in 2001. Crannell engaged in professional
    activities soon after reaching F &amp; M by serving on three national
    committees – the Joint Committee on Employment Opportunities (1992-
    1995), the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url> Committee on the Profession (1995-2000), and the <url href="https://www.ams.org">AMS</url>
    Short Course Committee (beginning in 2000). In addition she wrote articles,
    edited a video, and organized panels about finding jobs in mathematics in a
    tight market. Crannell was elected vice president of EPADEL for 1999-
    2001. Starting in 2001 she will become an Associate Editor of <pubtitle>Mathematics
    Magazine</pubtitle> and an editor of <pubtitle>MAA Notes</pubtitle> series.

<p><foreign>Secretary-Treasurers</foreign></p>
  <p>
    During the EPADEL period the four individuals who served as secretary-
    treasurer of the section continued the long tradition of lengthy, dedicated service.
    Altogether, 17 different people have been elected secretary-treasurer in the 75-
    year history of the section. However, three of them served only one year,
    meaning that the remaining 14 secretary-treasurers served a total of 72 years in
    office. We have already met two of the four secretary-treasurers who served in
    the EPADEL period – Will Baxter and Kay Somers. The latter was the only
    female to hold this position in the 75-year history of the section.
  </p>
  <p>
    We provide sketches of the other two secretary-treasurers below, but first we
    note that both of them have been particularly effective in their role as treasurer.
    In 1983 the section received a letter from Alfred B. Willcox at the national MAA
    indicating that the remission of $120 to the national office by treasurer Jim
    Brooks was <q>extraordinary.</q> Willcox added, <q>Aid to sections is available ... If
    the fortunes of EPADEL should take a turn for the worse, you might keep this in
    mind.</q> Although the section’s finances continued to run in the black, the
    treasurer’s report to the Executive Committee at the meeting held September
    1984 came with a caveat: <q>Our current bank balance is $578. We need to be
    careful about expenditures.</q> Subsequent treasurers carried on the tradition of
    careful expenditures, and in Cliff Wagner’s final account to the Executive
    Committee he reported a balance of over $13,000.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><term>James Oliver Brooks</term> was born in Evanston, Illinois. After obtaining his
    A.B. from Oberlin College in 1952 he entered the graduate program at the
    University of Michigan, receiving an M.A. the following year and a Ph.D. in
    1964. His dissertation on the theory of representation of modules was
    written under Donald Higman. While completing his graduate studies,
    Brooks accepted an assistant professorship at Haverford College, which he
    held from 1959 until 1964. He then moved to nearby Villanova University,
    where he taught until 1993. Brooks served the department as acting chair for
    one year, followed by an eight-year stint as chair, 1969-1977. He served on
    the section’s Executive Committee 1971-1973, and was elected secretary-
    treasurer 1982-1989.
    </li>
    <li xml:id="WagnerBio"><term>Clifford Henry Wagner</term> was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He received three
    degrees from three different institutions – an A.B. from Cincinnati in 1967,
    an A.M. from Michigan in 1968, and a Ph.D. from SUNY - Albany in 1973.
    His dissertation, <q>Symmetric, cyclic, and permutation products of
    manifolds</q>, was written under E. S. Thomas, Jr. Upon graduation Wagner
    accepted an assistant professorship at Fitchburg State College (MA), where
    he remained until moving to Penn State - Harrisburg in 1978. In addition to
    serving EPADEL as secretary-treasurer for six years, Wagner was elected to
    the Executive Committee 1993-1995. Beyond that, he has helped organize
    MATHCOUNTS competitions in the Capital Region since 1989. Wagner
    was presented with the MAA’s Allendoerfer Award in recognition of an
    article that appeared in the November 1982 issue of <pubtitle>Mathematics Magazine</pubtitle>.
    He also wrote (with Martin Barrett) the textbook <pubtitle>C and UNIX: Tools for

    <p><term>Lewis Carl Leinbach</term> is a native of Palmerton, PA, who received his B.A.
    at Lafayette College in 1962 and an M.S. two years later from the University
    of Delaware. He then went west for graduate school, earning his Ph.D. in
    1967 at the University of Oregon. His dissertation on order properties in
    Banach algebras was written under Bertram Yood. Carl Leinbach returned
    to the EPADEL area immediately upon receiving his degree, accepting a
    position at Gettysburg College. He was a member of the mathematics
    department at Gettysburg until 2000, when he joined the college’s new
    computer science department. Leinbach has been one of the most active
    members of EPADEL over the past 30 years. In addition to serving as
    governor, he was elected to the Executive Committee, was the SIG chair,
    and taught EPADEL-sponsored workshops at Messiah College in 1990 and
    1996. At the national level, he was a member of the MAA Classroom
    Resources Committee, the associate editor for software reviews in the
    <em>College Mathematics Journal</em>, and the editor of an MAA Notes volume on
    <q>Calculus as a Laboratory Course</q>. As a result of these activities, Leinbach

<p><foreign>Executive Committee</foreign></p>
  <p>
    Altogether 37 different individuals were elected to the Executive Committee
    during the 22-year EPADEL period. Five subsequently became officers, with
    three elected president – Nancy Hagelgans (Ursinus), David Hill (Temple), and
    Walter Stromquist (Daniel Wagner) – one vice-president – Annalisa Crannell
    (Franklin &amp; Marshall) – and one secretary-governor – Clifford Wagner (Penn
    State - Harrisburg). In a similar way three other Executive Committee members
    held other EPADEL positions: Anthony Berard (Wilkes), newsletter editor;
    JoAnne Growney (Bloomsburg), coordinator of the Visiting Lecturers series; and
    Robert DeVos (Villanova), publisher’s liaison. In addition, one member, James
    Crawford (Lafayette) was an invited lecturer at an annual meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three members of the Executive Committee served two three-years terms:
    Walter Stromquist, Dennis DeTurck, and Hanson Umoh. Stromquist was
    sketched above.
  </p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li xml:id="DeTurckBio"><term>Dennis Michael DeTurck</term> is a native Philadelphian who took all of his
    degrees in the city. Before receiving his bachelors degree from Drexel in
    1976 he was awarded the munificent sum of $12 from the section for
    achieving the highest score on the Putnam exam of any undergraduate
    within its boundaries. DeTurck then entered the graduate program at Penn,
    earning a masters degree in 1978 and a Ph.D. two years later. In his
    dissertation, written under Jerry L. Kazdan, DeTurck constructed a local
    theory for metrics having prescribed Ricci tensors. Following graduation he
    went to the Courant Institute as a post-doctoral instructor for two years. He
    returned to Penn after that and has remained there since 1982. DeTurck was
    promoted to full professor in 1989. He was the 1991 winner of the Lindback
    Award for Distinguished Teaching; four years later he was appointed to the
    Davidson Kennedy Professorship as a reward for successful undergraduate
    teaching. (One of Penn’s undergraduate students won the 2001 EPADEL
    Undergraduate Research Award.) DeTurck served as undergraduate chair of
    the department 1992-1997 and was elected chair in 1997. During his tenure
    he has directed six doctoral and two masters dissertations. DeTurck was an
    associate editor of the <pubtitle>Monthly</pubtitle> for ten years, <m>1986-1996</m>. During that time he
    was elected to the EPADEL Executive Committee for two three-year terms.
    Finally, DeTurck won the section’s Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.
    </li>
    <li><term>Hanson Matthew Umoh</term> came to the U.S. in 1970 from his native Nigeria,
    where he studied at the Federal School and Science in Lagos. Umoh earned
    a B.S. degree in mathematics from Virginia Union and an M.A. in
    mathematics from Morgan State. He accepted an instructorship at Howard
    University in 1981. While teaching he also took graduate courses there,
    resulting in a Ph.D. in 1988; he had been promoted to assistant professor the
    previous year. However, upon graduation he accepted an assistant
    professorship at Delaware State University, where he has remained ever
    since.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Traditionally three of the six members elected to the Executive Committee
    represent specific constituencies. In this regard, six members held nonacademic
    positions: the ubiquitous Stromquist, Barry Belkin (Daniel Wagner), Joseph J.
    Bolmarcich (Quantics), Gloria Dion (Educational Testing Service), Bruce
    Scranton (Daniel Wagner), and Michael Temple (Ketron). In addition, four
    members represented two-year institutions: Joanne S. Darken (Community
    College of Philadelphia), Roseanne Hofmann (Montgomery County Community
    College), Shirley C. Miller (Montgomery County Community College), and
    Robert J. Ulrey (Harrisburg Area Community College). Finally, four members
    were high-school teachers: Santo Diano (Central H. S.), Robert Murphey, the
    Rev. Joseph Oeschele (Malvern Prep), and Claire R. Tuckman (Cheltenham H.
    S.) Recall that Tuckman served another three-year stint on the Executive
    Committee during the period of expansion (Chapter 6).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before leaving the Executive Committee we note that 12 of the 39 different
    members in the EPADEL period were women. We have already mentioned
    Crannell, Darken, Dion, Growney, Hagelgans, Miller, Hofmann, and Tuckman.
    The others are Lynne Butler (Haverford), Penelope Dunham (Muhlenberg),
    Marialuisa McAllister (Moravian), and Patricia Overseer (Penn State – Ogontz).

<section><title>Presenters</title>
<p>
  During the period 1979-2000, most of the slots on the programs at annual fall
  meetings were taken up with the traditional mainstay, invited lectures on
  mathematical topics. Although no films were shown, the section set aside slots on
  the program for four other types of activities – contributed paper sessions,
  student paper sessions, a meeting for SIGs, and panel discussions.
</p>
<p>
  The first panel discussion was held in 1979. Its theme, <q>The machine in the
  garden: The relationship of computer sciences and the undergraduate
  mathematics major</q>, remains as relevant today as it was two decades ago. The
  three panelists were John Kellett (Gettysburg), John Koch (Wilkes), and Walter
  Brown (Moravian). The panel discussion conducted three years later, <q>CUPM
  recommendations</q>, was moderated by Gerald Porter (Penn) and included Joerg
  Mayer (Lebanon Valley) and Larry E. Sigler (Bucknell). In 1989 the panel
  discussion was titled <q>A model of an undergraduate research program in
  mathematics</q>. The program for the meeting lists only two speakers, Fred
  Schultheis (Moravian) and Clifford Reiter (Lafayette). The theme of the final
  panel in the section’s history, held in 1992, was <q>Encouraging participation
  among underrepresented groups</q>. This panel was a sequel to the section’s special
  session organized by Joanne S. Darken two years earlier. Along with Darken
  (Community College of Philadelphia,) the other panelists were Charles M.
  Grinstead (Swarthmore), Elizabeth W. McMahon (Lafayette), and Allen R.
  Schweinsberg (Bucknell).
</p>
<p>
  The largest part of the section’s annual meetings continued to be the invited
  lectures. Altogether 81 invited lectures were delivered from 1979 to 2000. After
  discussing the speakers and their affiliations, we analyze the topics of the lectures
  in terms of their mathematical classifications. The complete list of speakers and
  titles is given in an appendix.
</p>
<p>
  Altogether 76 different lecturers delivered the 81 invited talks, providing yet
  another indication of the impressively diverse mix of invited speakers the section
  was able to attract. The five lecturers who spoke twice during the EPADEL
  period were William Dunham (Muhlenberg), Ronald Graham (AT&amp;T), Paul
  Halmos (Indiana), Jerry King (Lehigh), and Herbert Wilf (Penn). Of the five
  repeat speakers, only Wilf had spoken at a meeting before this period. As noted
  earlier, Wilf is one of only five people to deliver four invited talks to the section.
  The all-time leader with five talks is Albert Wilansky.
</p>
<p>
  The list of 76 speakers includes several of national prominence, including
  Mark Kac, Kenneth Appel, Walter Feit, Stanislaw Ulam, Lynn Steen, Paul
  Halmos, Ronald Graham, Thomas Banchoff, John Conway, Uri Treisman, and
  Mary Ellen Rudin. Advances in air transportation during this period were
  responsible for the section’s ability to invite more and more speakers from
  outside the area.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, EPADEL members delivered 28 of the 81 lectures. One notable
  pairing is the duo of Herbert S. Wilf and Doron Zeilberger, whose work on the
  eponymous WZ-method earned them the prestigious Steele Prize in 1998 for
  seminal contributions to research. Also of local interest is the fact that the first
  African-American invited to deliver an address is an EPADEL member.
  However, Shiferaw Berhanu (Temple) was unable speak at the 1991 meeting due
  to illness. Robert S. Smith (Miami of Ohio) thus became the first African-
  American speaker four years later. To draw a longtime EPADEL connection,
  Smith received his Penn State Ph.D. in 1969 under Orrin Frink, who had spoke to
  the section in 1928 and 1932.
</p>
<p>
  During the EPADEL period, institutional affiliations of the speakers were
  more diverse than at any time in the section’s history, with 54 different
  institutions accounting for the 81 lecturers. Once again the University of
  Pennsylvania led the way with nine speakers. Next came Lehigh University with
  four, while Temple University and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories had three each.
  Eleven different institutions were home to exactly two invited lecturers:
  American University, the University of Delaware, Dartmouth College, Haverford
  College, Lafayette College, Indiana University, the MAA, Muhlenberg College,
  the Pennsylvania State University, Princeton University, and SUNY at
  Binghamton.
</p>
<p>
  <xref ref="Table23">Table</xref> lists all EPADEL members who presented invited lectures in this
  period, by institution. We comment on a few of the institutional affiliations.
  William Dunham’s talks in 1992 and 1999 mark the only time in the section’s
  history that a faculty member from Muhlenberg delivered an invited lecture.
  Similarly, talks by Paul Wolfson (1987), Kenneth A. Brakke (1993), and James
  P. Fink (1994) represent the only times that speakers have ever come from West
  Chester, Susquehanna, or Gettysburg, respectively. Although Gary Gordon was
  the sixth faculty member from Lafayette to give an invited lecture, his 1996 talk
  was the first since 1941; James Crawford kept the Lafayette tradition alive in
  1999.

<p>
Although the institutional affiliations of the speakers were diverse, all but five
speakers held academic positions, and none was a high school teacher. The
speakers holding nonacademic positions were Ronald Graham (AT&amp;T), John D.
Grace (Atlantic Richfield Corp.), Elaine Jacobson (Control Data Corp.), Fern
Hunt (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and Karvel Thornber
(NEC Research). Jacobson had obtained her Ph.D. at Temple under Theodore
Mitchell ten years before delivering her invited lecture in 1987.
</p>
</section>
<section><title>Themes of Lectures</title>
<p>
We end the chapter with an analysis of the mathematical classification of the
invited lectures presented at the annual EPADEL fall meetings from 1979 to
2000. Keeping in mind that strict classification is impossible, interested readers
are urged to consult the list of titles of all talks in the appendix, or abstracts
provided in sectional newsletters.
</p>
<p>
This period was witness to one dramatic development: talks in analysis no
longer dominated the programs, as they had done in every period heretofore. In
fact, the EPADEL period showed an almost even distribution among speakers in
the three main areas of mathematics: algebra/number theory (11.5),
topology/geometry (10.5), and analysis (9). The fractional part comes from
David Harbater’s 1996 talk, <q>Symmetry in algebra and geometry</q>.
This period also reflects three other noteworthy changes. For one, there were a
dozen talks related primarily to educational themes, continuing the section’s
involvement with the central concern that manifested itself in the 1950s. Second,
10 lectures were devoted to topics in the history of mathematics, the most ever.
Third, eight lectures discussed computer science. On a related note, the EPADEL
period bore witness to six talks on applications.
</p>
<p>
The talks in the <term>algebra/number</term> theory category were almost evenly divided
between the two subjects. The second lecture in the present period, presented in
1979 by local algebraist Willard Baxter, was titled <q>Rings with involution - An
overview</q>. The two lectures on algebra presented four years later were both
notable, one because of a local connection, with topologist/analyst Albert
Wilansky describing <q>What matrices can do</q>. Wilansky followed Yale’s Walter
Feit, who discussed the history and future prospects for completing the
classification of the finite simple groups. The next lecture on algebra did not
occur until 1996, when two more were given, including EPADEL member Gary
Gordon’s <q>Using symmetry in teaching group theory</q>.
</p>
<p>
Although none of the six speakers on number theory is a member of our
section, two have strong local ties. George Andrews, a Ph.D. student of Emil
Grosswald and Hans Rademacher at Penn, presented his recent research in a
lecture titled, <q>An old algorithm in a new era: Major MacMahon, you were born
too soon!</q> Andrews was one of only four invited speakers to take the podium at
Penn’s Centennial Celebration in 1999. It is not surprising that David Bressoud,
the other EPADEL speaker on number theory, would lecture on this subject
because he earned his Ph.D. at Temple under sectional governor Emil Grosswald
after having matriculated at Swarthmore. Bressoud’s 1988 talk <q>Factorization
and primality testing</q> was followed five years later by one of the country’s
leading experts in this field, Carl Pomerance. The three other speakers on topics
in number theory were internationally known Donald Zagier (1984), MAA
president Kenneth Ross (1997), and acclaimed great teacher Arthur Benjamin
(1999).
</p>
<p>
Of the 10.5 lectures in <term>geometry/topology</term>, seven were on topology proper,
four by EPADEL members: Kenneth A. Brakke of Susquehanna (1993), <q>Soap
films and covering spaces</q>, Herman Gluck of Penn (1989), <q>How can a drum
change shape while sounding the same?</q>, Judy Kennedy of Delaware (1990),
<q>Exotic topology in dynamical systems</q>, and James P. Fink of Gettysburg
(1994), <q>Bifurcation, catastrophe, singularity, and all that</q>. <xref ref="Expansion">Chapter</xref> described
Gluck’s invited lecture on topology in 1974.
</p>
<p>
Robert L. Devaney of Boston University delivered a particularly memorable
lecture in 1987 titled <q>Computer graphics experiments in complex dynamical
systems</q>. A pioneer in the use of computer graphics to demonstrate dynamical
systems, Devaney’s lecture included an impressive array of color graphics at a
time when such presentations attracted throngs of curious viewers.
</p>
<p>
We categorized David Harbater’s 1996 lecture as half algebra – half
geometry. Three of the lectures given in the present period were devoted to
purely geometrical subjects. Harbater’s Penn colleague Stephen S. Shatz gave an
invited lecture 12 years earlier entitled, <q>Mordell’s conjecture: Ideas and the
confluence of arithmetic and geometry</q>, which seems to suggest an intersection
with algebra as well. However, the remaining two talks in topology/geometry
were strictly geometric. In 1982 Peter Hilton (SUNY at Binghamton) gave a
lecture titled <q>Descartes, Euler, and polyhedra</q>. Ten years later Princeton’s John
Conway lectured on <q>Polyhedra and their symmetries</q> in his inimitable style,
replete with physical models to enhance the presentation.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that members of the Penn School of Analysis dominated the
invited lectures in the category of <term>analysis</term> until 1961, but Penn analysts gave
only three of the 14 talks from 1956 to 1978. This trend almost reached a limit of
zero in the present period, when the only talk on analysis given by someone
associated with Penn was <q>Strange attractors and chaotic motion</q>, by Jerry P.
Golub, who held a joint appointment in physics at Haverford and Penn in 1985.
Two Temple analysts accepted invitations to speak on analysis during this period
but only famed problem-solver Donald J. Newman (1985) was able to deliver his,
<q>Addition chains when multiplications are free</q>. Shiferaw Berhanu (1991) was
prevented by illness from presenting, <q>A nonlinear Fourier transform and its
applications to complex vector fields</q>.
</p>
<p>
Temple was not the only institution with two faculty members lecturing on
analysis. In addition to Jerry Golub, Haverford’s chair Curtis Greene presented
the very first lecture in the present period, <q>Problems and results in unimodal
sequences</q>. The only other talk on analysis during this period by an EPADEL
member was <q>Real, complex, and metaphysical ideas of Karl Weierstrass</q> by
Jerry King (Lehigh) in 1997. Some prominent members of the American
mathematical community who spoke on themes from analysis during this period
include Richard Anderson of LSU (1980), Paul Halmos of Santa Clara (1987),
and Mary Ellen Rudin of Wisconsin (1993). Rudin is yet another prize graduate
of the famous R. L. Moore School of Topology to speak to our section.
</p>
<p>
This chapter has already described the section’s overwhelming preoccupation
with various themes in education during the entire EPADEL period in various
realms. To support the notion that educational themes presented the
membership’s overarching concern, the section invited 12 speakers to address
educational issues on a wide range of subjects, more than any other category.
</p>
<p>
EPADEL members delivered two of these talks. In 1984 Temple’s Raymond
F. Coughlin, a pioneer in <q>short calculus</q> texts, gave a lecture about teaching
what then was becoming an increasing problem at many institutions, students ill-
prepared for university-level mathematics. The title of Coughlin’s talk,
<q>Remediation: A waste or a gold mine?</q>, provides no clue to the speaker’s strong
feeling that remediation presented a potential lucrative market for universities if
they took it seriously. Lafayette’s James Crawford presented a talk about
teaching a contrasting set of students. At the 1999 meeting commemorating the
100 th anniversary of Elizabethtown College, Crawford dealt with students who
came to college well prepared for calculus courses in a talk titled <q>Teaching
calculus: A personal, institutional, and historical perspective</q>.
</p>
<p>
Individuals with strong MAA ties delivered five of the remaining ten lectures
that carried educational themes. In 1982 Alan C. Tucker, of SUNY at Stony
Brook, whose father, Princeton’s Albert W. Tucker, lectured to the section in
1938, 1948, and 1957, described the <q>Mathematical sciences curricula</q>. His talk
was immediately followed by an EPADEL panel discussion on a related topic,
<q>CUPM recommendations</q>. Two years later, MAA president-elect Lynn A Steen
(St. Olaf) made a plea for <q>Renewing undergraduate mathematics</q>. Two years
after that, in 1988, Martha Siegel (Towson State) discussed <q>Freshman
mathematics for the modern age</q>. The sectional newsletter for that meeting
carried an MAA advertisement for the position of Executive Director. Thanks to
the knowledge and foresight of sectional governor Gerald Porter, the person
chosen to fill that position, Marsha Sward, gave her very first presentation to any
MAA section at the meeting held the next year at Millersville. In a lecture titled
<q>Everybody counts: From vision to reality</q>, Sward discussed timely work
initiated by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The very next
year, Kenneth Hoffman, then Director of the Mathematical Sciences Education
Board, continued this line of investigation in his lecture, <q>Mathematics education
reform: Our critical role</q>.
</p>
<p>
There are three other categories in which numerous invited talks were
presented, history (10), computer science (8), and applications (6). This was the
very first period in the section’s history when talks dealing with the <term>history of
mathematics</term> attracted such widespread interest. Local historians Paul Wolfson
(West Chester) and William Dunham (Muhlenberg) accounted for three of the
10. Earlier in this chapter we noted Wolfson’s involvement with European tours
covering various aspects of the history of mathematics. A book-review editor for
the journal Historia Mathematica, he highlighted one of those aspects in his 1987
talk, <q>Newton: The calculus, the Principia</q>. The other local historian, the
husband of present Executive Committee member Penelope Dunham of
Muhlenberg College, presented two invited lectures during the 1990s. The clever
title of his 1992 talk was <q>Constructing the regular heptadecagon: Ingenuity or
just a lucky Gauss?</q> The topic of Dunham’s 1999 lecture, <q>Euler’s sums and
Euler’s crumbs</q>, concerned the main theme from one of his best-selling books,
<em>Euler: The Master of Us All</em>. (Recall from <xref ref="WWII">Chapter</xref> that the Koehler family
donated a set of Euler’s works to the library at Muhlenberg College.)
</p>
<p>
Distinguished historians delivered five of the remaining lectures on the history
of mathematics. In 1985 Ann Hibner Koblitz (University of Washington) read the
paper, <q>The mythification of Sofia Kovalevskaya</q>. The very next year V.
Frederick Rickey (Bowling Green) answered many a question asked by calculus
teachers everywhere in his talk, <q>The invention of calculus: Who, what, when,
where, and why?</q> Just two years later Harold Edwards, of the Courant Institute
at NYU, spoke about <q>Kronecker’s views of the foundations of mathematics</q>. In
1995 Marcia Ascher, recently retired from Ithaca College, presented <q>Tracings in
the sand: An introduction to ethnomathematics</q>, while three years after that
James Tattersall (Providence College) showed some <q>Mathematical vignettes
from Cambridge University</q>.
</p>
<p>
In the remaining two talks on the history of mathematics, two prominent
members of the international mathematical community reminisced about their
involvement in the development of the subject in the 20 th century. In 1980 Mark
Kac presented <q>Recollections and reflections on 50 years of probability theory</q>
and three years later Stanislaw Ulam gave <q>Mathematical reminiscences and
suggestions for the future</q>. The 1983 meeting was held at Bryn Mawr College,
the home of John Oxtoby, our section’s former president and Ulam’s good friend.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 noted the section’s interest in computers as early as 1970, when it
sponsored a panel discussion on their place in the mathematics curriculum. This
interest intensified in the present period, which featured eight lectures on topics
related directly to <term>computer science</term>. Two of these talks were given by
individuals with ties to Temple University. In 1987 Elaine Jacobson, a Ph.D.
graduate of Temple then employed by Control Data Corporation, spoke about
<q>Parallel processing architectures</q>. Twelve years later, Temple faculty member
Doron Zeilberger spoke about the role of computing in the future in a lecture that
carried the unusual title, <q>Synopses of two textbooks: Levi Ben Gerson’s Ma’asei
Khoshev (ca. 1320) and Shalosh B. Ekhad’s Plane Geometry (ca. 2050).</q>
</p>
<p>
Three of the remaining talks on computer science were presented by
distinguished personalities in the field. In 1985 Frank Thomson (Tom) Leighton
of the Department of Mathematics and the Lab for Computer Science at MIT
spoke on <q>Networks, parallel computation and VLSI</q>. At the Sunday meeting the
following year Thomas Kurtz (Dartmouth) presented a talk called <q>Computing in
the classroom</q>. Kurtz is one of the inventors of the language BASIC, which was
taught to all undergraduate students at Dartmouth since the late 1950s. The final
speaker from this New England troika was recent MAA president-elect Thomas
Banchoff (Brown), who in 1991 presented the invited address titled, <q>Computer
graphics and surfaces in four-space: Visualizing characteristic classes</q>.
</p>
<p>
Although the section sponsored six talks on traditional <term>applications</term> of
mathematics during the present period, the types of applications varied
considerably. The two lectures by EPADEL members concentrated on
economics. In 1994, J. Michael Steele, of the Wharton School at Penn, spoke on
<q>Ruin and riches from Bachelier to Black-Scholes</q>. Four years later Lehigh’s
Vladimir Dobric lectured on a similar theme in his presentation, <q>A fundamental
model in mathematical finance</q>. The other four speakers described a range of
applications whose content can be inferred from their titles – Ward Whitt (1980;
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories), <q>Approximation for networks of queues (description
of complex systems adequate for engineering purposes)</q>, Daniel Gottlieb (1988;
Purdue), <q>Topology and the robot arm</q>, John D. Grace (1990; Atlantic Richfield
Corp.), <q>Oil and uncertainty</q>, and Joseph A. Gallian (1993; Minnesota), <q>The
mathematics of identification numbers</q>.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 noted that Penn’s Herbert S. Wilf presented the very first lecture in
the category <term>combinatorics/graph</term> theory in 1967. He gave two more talks on
this topic during the present period: <q>Some bijective proofs in combinatorics</q>
(1982) and <q>Finding and proving identities with your computer</q> (1995). Wilf’s
stranglehold was broken in 1997 when Rodica Simion (George Washington)
lectured on <q>The many lives of set partitions</q>. The same could be said about a
1998 talk by Wilf’s partner in proving identities, Doron Zeilberger, but we
categorized the latter talk under computer science.
</p>
<p>
Three lectures were devoted to <term>probability/statistics</term> in this period, although
one of them was a hybrid. As the title <q>Probability and the approximation of
continuous functions</q> suggests, the lecture delivered by former EPADEL
governor Jerry King of Lehigh in 1981 contained as much analysis as probability.
The invited lecture by Mary Gray (American University) carried the fetching
title, <q>Justice by lot: Olympic gold medals, Rwandan prisoners and employment
discrimination</q>. Gray had been one of the founders of the Association for
Women in Mathematics. The remaining talk in this category was special too.
Recall that Shif Berhanu had to cancel his talk due to illness. On almost no
notice, Alan J. Rossman (Dickinson) prepared a lecture with another alluring
title, <q>Bayesian statistics in the courtroom</q>. The section chair at the time, Walter
Stromquist, has called Rossman a hero for his duty beyond the call of service.
</p>
<p>
There was only one talk on <term>mathematical logic</term> during this period, and
someone with nonacademic credentials delivered it. In 1994 Karvel Thornber, of
the NEC Research Institute, presented a paper with the title, <q>Inference beyond
logic</q>.
</p>
<p>
Seven lectures seem to defy exact classification yet are worthy of mention.
Penn professors delivered three of them. In a perspicacious presentation in 1980
sectional governor Gerald Porter spoke about <q>The future of the MAA</q>. In 1991
his colleague Dennis DeTurck answered the question, <q>What problems are we
trying to solve?</q> DeTurck described several problems in which powerful theories
were developed to deal with generalized problems while the original <q>simple</q>
problem remained unresolved. Four years later Sampath Kannan spoke on
<q>Tractable algorithms for phylogeny reconstruction</q>.
</p>
<p>
Two of the remaining lectures in the <q>miscellaneous</q> category were
concerned with the mathematics involved in juggling, by Ronald Graham of
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, in 1991 and 1998. Ten years before Graham’s first
lecture/demonstration the renowned author Paul R. Halmos asked <q>Does
mathematics have elements?</q> Immediately after lunch Kenneth Appel lectured
on his celebrated – and controversial – computer-aided proof (with Wolfgang
Haken) of the four-color problem, which had been completed in 1976.
</p>
<p>
Overall, this chapter has indicated that the greatest number of activities at
annual meetings during the period 1979-2000 was concerned with educational
issues, as reflected principally by panel discussions and invited lectures. Among
the invited lectures, there was almost a dead heat among the three major
categories of mathematics. Close on the heels of the <q>big three</q> were the history
of mathematics, computer science, and applications.

<section><title>Profile: Marvin Linus Brubaker</title>
<idx><h>Profile</h><h> Brubaker, Marvin Linus</h></idx>
<p>
Marvin L. Brubaker was born in rural Snyder County in Central Pennsylvania.
He attended public schools and then enrolled at Susquehanna University (located
in Selinsgrove, PA), where he received an A.B. (cum laude) in 1961. He carried a
double major in both physics and mathematics.
</p>
<p>
After a year of teaching mathematics and science at Middleburg High School,
Brubaker enrolled in the graduate program at Bowling Green University. He
taught physics labs and problem sessions while completing requirements for his
M.A. in mathematics in 1964. This was followed by a three-year appointment as
instructor in mathematics at his alma mater, Susquehanna, 1964-1967. He then
accepted an assistant professorship at Moravian College. This move to the
Lehigh Valley made it particularly convenient to begin work toward his doctorate
at Lehigh University. In spite of teaching full-time all the while, Brubaker earned
his Ph.D. in October 1973 for a dissertation titled, <q>A comparison of the Shukla
cohomology with a cotriple cohomology</q>, and written under Franklin
Brenneman.
</p>
<p>
Brubaker remained at Moravian for 16 years, serving as chair of the
mathematics department the last nine years. In 1983 he moved to Messiah
College, where he has remained ever since. During his tenure at Messiah he has
been actively involved in faculty development and the process of introducing
technology into the classroom. In addition, he has directed more than 120
secondary mathematics student teachers and has been actively involved in
offering technology workshops locally, regionally, and nationally. (He has
presented workshops on Derive in 14 states and two provinces!) He has also
spent a considerable amount of time coaching students for presentations at
EPADEL meetings and at the Moravian College Student Paper Conference.
</p>
<p>
To accomplish his goal of introducing technology, Brubaker organized and
directed three one-week faculty development workshops at Moravian College
and followed up with more than 18 similar workshops at Messiah College from
1986 to the present time. Several workshops received NSF support. Since many
of them were sponsored by EPADEL, they stand as perhaps his most visible
contribution to the section.
</p>
<p>
But workshops represent only a portion of Brubaker’s volunteer activities
with the section. He was elected president for two one-year terms, 1987-1989,
after being vice-president for two one-year terms. Not surprisingly he has also
served as workshop coordinator for the section, holding that position from 1985
to the present. In addition, he was elected sectional Governor for a three-year
term, 1992-1995.
</p>
<p>
In appreciation for all these volunteer activities, in January 1996 Brubaker
was the recipient of the Award for Distinguished Service for the EPADEL
Section, an award given by the national MAA. In addition, he served as a
member of Mini Course Committee of the MAA from 1992 to 1998. He has also
been an active participant with the MAA’s interactive mathematics text project.
