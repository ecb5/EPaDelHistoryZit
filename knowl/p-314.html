<div class="para">In 1936 W. R. Murray of Franklin and Marshall College described the undergraduate comprehensive examination developed by the faculty at F &amp; M. Murray maintained that although F &amp; M’s system of comprehensive examinations offered decided advantages in coordinating a student’s course of study, it was more difficult to construct in mathematics than in other areas. In spite of observing several desirable gains, “the experiment is still too new and the operation too imperfect to make any enthusiastic claims for the plan.” Apparently the system of comprehensive exams flourished until the 1960s, when they began to disappear across the college. The major hurdle seemed to be the conundrum of the student who, having passed all courses, performed poorly on the comprehensive exams. In mathematics, one of the consequences was to lower the level of the exam to meet the students’ achievement, clearly not the intention of the system. Sometime in the early 1970s Franklin &amp; Marshall eliminated comprehensive examinations altogether.</div>
