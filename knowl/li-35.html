<em class="alert">Frank Mark Weida</em> (1891-1977) was born in Allentown to Penrose John and Sarah Rebecca (Mark) Weida. He made his biggest contributions to EPADEL while a resident of nearby Bethlehem. After receiving a B.S. degree from Kenyon College in 1913 he spent the following year as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University but dropped out to become the head of the mathematics and science department at St. Albans School in Knoxville, Tennessee. That was the position he held when he became one of the charter members of the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-142-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> in 1916. In the fall of that year he returned to graduate school. However, after spending a year as a teaching assistant at the University of Chicago he left without obtaining a degree. Instead, he accepted an instructorship in mathematics at the University of Iowa while pursuing graduate studies, culminating in a Ph.D. in 1923. One year later he was appointed assistant professor at Montclair State College in New Jersey, a position he held for only one year before accepting the same position at Lehigh University. He remained at Lehigh from 1925 to 1930. During this period he was a charter member of, and an active contributor to, the Philadelphia Section.</div>
<div class="para">F. M. Weida then took a position at George Washington University, where he remained for the rest of his life. He served as head of the mathematics department from 1935 until his retirement in 1957. While at GWU he became an eminent statistician who applied the subject to problems of interest to the military. One year after being appointed head of the department, the 44-year old Weida married Opal Fern Dickson. The couple had two children, Charles Rietz and Mary Elizabeth. Their son’s middle name honors Weida’s dissertation supervisor from Iowa, the renowned statistician H. L. Rietz. Frank Weida died on September 13, 1977, just two weeks shy of his 86th birthday.He is buried in Christ Episcopal Churchyard in Port Republic, Maryland.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-17.html#li-35" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
