<div class="para">The second column in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table18.html" title="Table 7.1.1: ">Table 7.1.1</a> lists the locations of the 22 annual fall meetings, which were held at 17 different institutions. Drexel University and the Penn State campus in Montgomery County (which underwent a name change recently) hosted three meetings each. Since the section’s founding in 1926, Drexel has hosted seven fall meetings, with at least one in each decade since the first one in 1953. (The meeting held there in 1991 coincided with the university’s 100 th anniversary.) It is a completely different story for the Penn State campus, formerly Ogontz, now Abington. The section only met there in the present period, and one person deserves the lion’s share of the credit. (The meeting there in 2000 coincided with the branch campus’s 50 th anniversary. Those who attended were given commemorative T-shirts.)</div>
