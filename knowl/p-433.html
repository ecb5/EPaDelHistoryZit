<div class="para">Webber must have enjoyed the EPADEL area because after one year at Penn and another at the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago, he moved to the University of Delaware and remained there for the rest of his life. Appointed an instructor in 1937, he rose through the ranks until becoming a full professor in 1948. One year later Webber was elected chairman of the Philadelphia Section. The following year he succeeded C. J. Rees as chairman of the mathematics department at Delaware, a position he held for 14 years. In addition, from 1958 to 1971 he also held the Universityâ€™s prestigious H. Fletcher Brown Professorship. He retired as emeritus professor in 1971.</div>
