<div class="para">The program for the 1988 meeting consisted of four lectures on the theme of the day, operations research. Shippensburg’s Fred Nordal, the recipient of a Virginia Tech Ph.D. in operations research, began the day with a talk titled, “Origin, history and some applications of operations research”. He was followed by George Freestone, the manager of operations research for chemical systems development and services at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. His talk on “Logistics planning for chemicals at Air Products” dealt with the application of linear programming to customer sourcing and product mix problems in the chemicals business. Next, Jeffrey Lagarias of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories provided EPADEL members with an updating on very recent developments in his lecture titled, “Karmarkar’s linear programming algorithm and nonlinear programming”. The final speaker, Temple’s Leon Steinberg, spoke on “Simulation and the Monte Carlo method”. He based his remarks on the history and application of Monte Carlo methods from his vast years of experience as a mathematical consultant.</div>
