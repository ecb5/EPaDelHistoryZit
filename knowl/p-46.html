<div class="para">Over the next <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> years state sections were formed in Kentucky, Illinois, Texas, Michigan, and Nebraska. Three other sections were formed from unions of states - the Rocky Mountain Section (Colorado and Wyoming), the Southeastern Section (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, the two Carolinas, and Tennessee) and the Louisiana-Mississippi Section. One new section was a subset of a state - the Southern California Section. The latter was formed at the urging of Earle Hedrick, who had moved from the University of Missouri to the University of California, Southern Branch (now UCLA). Hedrick acted as temporary chairman of the section until a formal election of officers could be held.</div>
