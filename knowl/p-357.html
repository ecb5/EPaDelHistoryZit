<dfn class="terminology">Cyril Arthur Nelson</dfn> (1893-1984) was born and raised in Kansas. He received his A.B. degree from Midland College (Kansas) in 1914 and his A.M. from the University of Kansas in 1916. He enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton University for the year 1916-1917 before transferring to the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1919 without an official supervisor. Nelson taught at three different colleges before accepting a position in 1927 at the New Jersey College for Women, which was founded in 1918 and later became affiliated with Rutgers University. He remained at Rutgers until his retirement in 1959. He died in 1984 at the age of 90.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Emory P. Starke</dfn> 1896-1989) was born in New York City. He received all three of his degrees from Columbia University: A.B. 1916, M.A. 1917, and Ph.D. 1928. He joined the faculty at Rutgers in 1919 at age 23 and stayed there until compulsory retirement as professor emeritus in 1961. Instead of retiring completely, however, Starke spent the next five years as a professor at Bloomfield College. An inveterate problem solver, he is known to many present EPADEL members for his longtime stint of Associate Editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> and for his many contributions to its problems department. He took over the advanced problems section of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> in 1947 when that departmentâ€™s first editor, Otto Dunkel, asked to be relieved. Starke died in 1989 at age 93.</div></li>
