The table also shows that initially the move to the Philadelphia area witnessed a surge in attendance, but that the figures dropped precipitously from a peak of 75 in 1928 to only 39 just two years later. A likely explanation for this decline is the stock market crash that intervened between the two meetings. With transportation presenting a greater obstacle than today, it is not surprising that the two meetings held at Lehigh attracted smaller audiences than those held in the Philadelphia area, where a network of trains, trolleys, buses, and subway lines minimized transportation inconvenience.</div>
