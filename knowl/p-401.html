<div class="para">Talks on analysis were not given by the Penn School alone. Penn State’s H. J. Curry, who was assigned to the Frankford Arsenal in 1942, spoke about “The Heaviside operational calculus”. It would be 30 years before Curry would return to deliver another lecture to the section. In 1950 Albert Wilansky spoke about his emerging specialty, functional analysis, in a talk titled “The essential roughness of mathematical objects”. Wilansky’s results were based on earlier findings by S. Banach and A. Zygmund.</div>
