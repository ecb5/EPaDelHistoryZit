<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table12.html" title="Table 5.2.1: ">Table 5.2.1</a> addresses the section’s governance based on elections held at annual meetings from 1942 through 1955. Recall our convention that the year 1942 means that Drexel’s James E. Davis was elected chairman of the section at the meeting held in November 1942 but carried out most of his duties during the year 1943, including the running of the annual meeting that year. The section continued to benefit from a cadre of active leaders, altogether boasting 12 different chairmen in 14 years, with Cyril Nelson (Women’s College of New Jersey) and Perry Caris (University of Pennsylvania) the only chairs elected to two (nonconsecutive) terms. Many other contributions by Caris have already been cited, principally his service as secretary from 1928 through 1941.</div>
