<em class="alert">Benjamin Franklin Finkel (1865-1947)</em> earned a B. S. degree from Ohio Northern in 1888 and then taught high school mathematics. He managed to stay professionally active by contributing to the problem departments in several publications, including the Saturday Evening Post. In 1895 Finkel was appointed professor of mathematics and physics at Drury College in Missouri, where in 1894 he began to publish the <span class="booktitle">American Mathematical Monthly</span> in order to improve instruction in high school mathematics. His first action in publishing the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> was to secure the editorial assistance of a high school teacher, <em class="alert">John Colaw</em>, who had received a bachelors degree (<span class="process-math">\(1882\)</span>) and a masters degree (<span class="process-math">\(1892\)</span>) from Dickinson College.</div>
<div class="para">Colaw’s background at Dickinson provides one link between the Philadelphia area and the founding of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.
