<div class="para">Another activity from this period concerned teaching standards, an issue that reappeared on the national scene in the 1990s, although standards in the 1950s were much different than standards in the 1990s. Once again the secretary’s report from the 1959 meeting provides precious little information. F. L. Dennis wrote, “Professor Lehr reported on the Professional Standards Conference.” However, Dennis supplied further details in his report from the next meeting, writing, “At the business meeting Professor J. A. Brown reported on the progress of the Committee on Professional Standards.” An elaboration of this statement reveals that the entire afternoon session was devoted to this theme, beginning with a keynote address by Howard Fehr of the Teachers College at Columbia. A panel on “Professional standards for teachers of mathematics in the school” followed. B. H. Bissinger (then at Lebanon Valley) moderated the discussion along with three participants: Albert Filano (West Chester) and two Philadelphia high-school teachers, K. S. Kalman and Joseph Gavin. The panel’s recommendations make fascinating reading almost 50 years later. One can only wonder what the present state of high school and college mathematics might be if the committee’s recommendations had been enacted.</div>
