<div class="para">One other course I took at the same time was somewhat similar. It was taught by Professor Mitchell, whom I liked very much. He took a book, I think it was by Dr. Pierpont, in the area of functions of a real variable. I guess Professor Mitchell had found on inspection that not all of Professor Pierpontâ€™s proofs held up, so the way he taught this course in that subject, he gave us this book, but asked us to go through all the proofs that were given and find out whether they were watertight proofs or not and if not, why not. This course had many elements of the other course.</div>
