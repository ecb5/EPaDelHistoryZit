<div class="para">Dissertation Title: <span class="booktitle">Hecke Theory over Complex Quadratic Fields</span>
</div></aside>        graduated summa cum laude with a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Pennsylvania, and he earned his PhD from M.I.T. with a dissertation in analytic number theory under Harold Stark. In 1983, after a stint as the Lawton Lecturer at Temple University, Styer joined the faculty of Villanova University, where he taught a wide range of courses and held many positions in university leadership, including Chair of the Department of Mathematics Sciences (later the Department of Mathematics and Statistics) (1997-2003), Chair of the University Senate (2008-2014). He has been the Director of the Comprehensive Science program since 2011 and expects to remain in that position until about 2026.</div>
<div class="para">Styer served as EPADEL President (2007-2009), multiple terms as an At-Large member of the Executive Committee, and was a local organizer for section meetings in spring of 1999, fall of 2005, and fall of 2016.

<div class="para">Dissertation Title: <span class="booktitle">On the Global and Local Moduli of Continuity of Brownian Motion</span>
</div></aside> was born in Camden, New Jersey, and attended Rider College with a major in Mathematics and Secondary Education before doing her graduate work at Lehigh University. In 2002, she completed her PhD in Probability and Mathematical Finance under the direction of Vladimir Dobric.</div>
<div class="para">Lisa took a tenure-track position at LaSalle University immediately upon graduation from Lehigh University, but the following year she moved into a tenure-track position at West Chester University. She has remained at WCU to this date, moving through the academic ranks and founding the West Chester University Actuarial Science program. She is currently Associate Dean for the College of Mathematics and Sciences.</div>
<div class="para">Within EPADEL, Lisa served in the elected positions of Vice Chair, Chair, and Section Representative after serving in the Executive Committee from 2005 – 2007 as an at-large member. Before that she served as one of the coordinators of Section NExT. In that role, along With Kate McGivney, she secured funding for joint programming with AMATYC’s Project ACCCESS.</div>
<div class="para">Lisa has the distinction of being the last occupant of two positions within EPADEL. While she was serving as Section President in 2008 EPADEL's By Laws were updated and the title was changed to "Chair."  She was also serving as Section Governor when the 2017 MAA By Laws update changed that title to "Section Representative to MAA Congress." Starting in 2018 Lisa has been a member of the MAA's Board of Directors as a consequence of serving as the Chair of the Committee on Sections.                            </div>

In 1996 he became an Assistant Professor at the DuBois campus of Penn State and joined the Allegheny Mountain Section of the MAA where he served in various leadership roles between 1996 and 2006 when he moved to Penn State’s Harrisburg campus (Capital College). Because Penn State campuses are split between two MAA sections this move made him a member of the EPADEL section, where he remained for the duration of his career.</div>
<div class="para">He served on the EPADEL Executive Board as the book table coordinator, as a Member-At-Large, Vice Chair, and Chair. He was appointed the first Section Historian when that position was created in 2011.</div>

</div></aside> was raised outside of Philadelphia, PA (specifically in the towns of Bensalem and Holland). She had to switch schools in her very early years and because of inconsistencies in the schedules of the schools she learned to add and subtract before she learned to read.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen earned her B.S.Ed. from Millersville University in 2002, her M.S. from Lehigh University in 2004, and her Ph.D. also from Lehigh in 2008.

She was promoted to Associate Professor of Instruction in 2018.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen served on the EPADEL Executive Board as a Member-At-Large (2011-2017), Vice Chair (2018-2019), and Chair (2020-2021). Her predecessor as both Chair and Vice Chair was her former real analysis professor at Millersville, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CatepillanBio.html" title="Item">Ximena Catepillan</a>.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen has the dubious and unsought distinction of being the only Chair or President of the section never to have stood in front of the assembled membership to conduct a meeting.  She became chair just after to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfortunately, the pandemic coincided almost exactly with Ellen’s time as Chair so she was never able to preside over a physical meeting of the section.</div>
