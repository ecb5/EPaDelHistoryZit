<div class="para">Afterwards the couple returned to South Dakota, where Alexander Pell had been promoted to Dean of Engineering. Anna Pell taught courses in the fall semester, but in the spring she returned to Göttingen alone to complete work on her thesis. An apparent disagreement with Hilbert caused her to leave without a doctorate. However, she departed with a completed thesis. When Anna Pell returned to the United States she joined her husband in Chicago. She was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1910 after satisfying the university’s one-year residency requirement. It was only appropriate that E. H. Moore be listed as her thesis advisor because Moore was a Hilbert enthusiast who was involved with research on integral equations, the topic of Pell’s dissertation, at that time.</div>
