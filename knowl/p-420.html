<div class="para">Whereas five lectures in the period 1933-1941 dealt with either curricular or pedagogical issues, the present period sponsored seven, highlighted by the three- person presentation “Mathematics through the television lens” at the 1954 meeting. Since the presentation consisted of three people describing their experiences in designing new ways to communicate mathematics using an emerging technology, the presentation serves as a preview of one that might be conducted today under the title “Mathematics on the Internet”. First, F. G. Fender reported on a 13-week series of talks presented on TV at his home institution, Rutgers. The aim of this series was to help the general public gain a clearer understanding of “the story of the modern mathematician and his work”. Next Bryn Mawr’s Marguerite Lehr described a 15-week series of half-hour talks presented on one of Philadelphia’s three major channels. (For details on the series see her article in the January 1955 <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, pp. 15-21.) In the final part of the presentation, Delaware’s R. F. Jackson bonded two emerging technologies when he outlined the general philosophy and specific plans for a TV series titled “Thinking machines – From fingers to flip-flops”.</div>
