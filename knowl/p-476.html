<div class="para">The report from the 1972 meeting mentions the MAA dues structure for the first time. It states that at the business meeting, “The Section voted to support a graduated dues structure for the Mathematical Association of America.” Annual dues had been set at <span class="process-math">\(\$3\)</span> for the MAA’s first year, <span class="process-math">\(1916\text{,}\)</span> but increased to <span class="process-math">\(\$4\)</span> five years later. The amount remained at $4 until 1957, leading MAA President Lester Ford to quip that the three most famous mathematical constants were <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> Dues rose to <span class="process-math">\(\$5\)</span> in 1957 and <span class="process-math">\(\$6\)</span> in 1968. A graduated dues structure has been in effect since the mid-1970s.</div>
