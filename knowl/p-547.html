<div class="para">Five lectures on geometry combined with the 12 on topology make the geometry/topology classification the most popular. We already mentioned geometry talks by Samuel Gulden and Doris Schattschneider. Famous mathematicians delivered the remaining three lectures. A. S. Besicovitch, known for his negative answer to the Kakeya conjecture, spoke on a related topic in his 1959 talk, “Some extremal problems in geometry”. Initially he had selected a different subject, as suggested by the title he first submitted, “Sharpening Lebesque theorems on differentiation”, but he must have changed his mind in the days leading up to the meeting. It does not seem to be well known that Besicovitch directed a Ph.D. dissertation at Penn in 1962. In 1970 Washington’s Victor Klee discussed “Some unsolved problems from intuitive geometry,” and one year later Rafael Artzy viewed “Analytic geometry stripped of all but incidence”. Artzy was then at Temple University, but in 1976 he became the department head at the University of Haifa in Israel.</div>
