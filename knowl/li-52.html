<dfn class="terminology">Truman Lester Koehler</dfn> (1902-1989) was a Lehigh Valley citizen through and through. Born in Bethlehem, PA, he graduated from Muhlenberg College in 1924, taught at Allentown Prep School for the next three years, and then joined the faculty of his alma mater in 1927. He remained there for 45 years and chaired the mathematics department for 14 of them. During this time, Koehler managed to pick up his M.A. in 1932 and his Ph.D. in 1950 – both from the University of Pennsylvania. His doctorate was in mathematics education for a dissertation titled, “The selection of certain significant concepts in college algebra and the determination of their degree of emphasis in some widely adopted texts”. In World War II, Koehler directed Muhlenberg’s Engineering, Science, Management, and War Training Program and, as noted above, served as chair of the Philadelphia Section 1954-1955. He died in 1989, just two weeks shy of his 87 th birthday. His son, Truman Koehler, Jr. – a statistician and successful businessman – has been instrumental in keeping alive the memory of his father by generous contributions to the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Muhlenberg. These include a gift of Euler’s mathematical works to the college library, the commissioning of portraits of his parents that now hang outside the departmental offices (Mrs. Koehler was a friend of the students for the better part of half a century), and an endowment for the Truman Koehler Professorship. The present Koehler Professor of Mathematics is William Dunham, who, as many MAA members can attest, has taken full advantage of Koehler’s bequest of Euler’s works.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-52" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
