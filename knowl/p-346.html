<div class="para">The second column lists the sites of these 14 meetings. Clearly the University of Pennsylvania dominated, hosting eight gatherings, including every one during WW II. The twin institutions, Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College, hosted postwar meetings in 1947 and 1949, respectively. (Bryn Mawr was always a women’s college. Haverford was a men’s college until 1978, when women transfer students were first admitted; the first fully coeducational class entered in 1980.) Consequently the 1950 meeting at Lehigh University marked the first time the section met outside the Philadelphia area since Lehigh hosted the annual affair in 1939. The site of the 1952 meeting – the University of Delaware – marked the first time the section sponsored a meeting in the “First State”. This location represents the culmination of activity by Delaware members that had increased dramatically throughout the 1940s.</div>
