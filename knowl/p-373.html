<div class="para">As we saw in earlier periods, many members of the Program Committee also were elected to other offices so we provide biographical facts the first time they held that office. However, during the period under review three members who served multiple terms but were never elected to other offices deserve special mention: F. L. Dennis, who was one of four people to serve two terms, N. J. Fine, who was elected to three terms in the period, and W. R. Murray. Some prominent names also served one term on the committee: Arthur Everett Pitcher (Lehigh), I. J. Schoenberg and A. D. Wallace (Penn), and A. W. Tucker and J. W. Tukey (Princeton).</div>
