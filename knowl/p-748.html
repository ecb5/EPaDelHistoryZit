<div class="para">The following year president Hill wrote, “The theme of this year’s spring meeting is Decision Sciences ... While there is significant movement to reform our calculus instruction format, there is ample reason to believe that a similar effort in elementary statistics instruction should be initiated at a variety of levels.” William E. Rosenthal addressed the same issue in his opening lecture, “No more sadistics [sic], no more sadists, no more victims”, in which he called for a radical reconstruction of the standard college-level elementary statistics course. Besides being a member of the mathematics department at Ursinus, Rosenthal was the co-coordinator of the College’s women’s studies program. In the final talk of the day, Temple statistician Janos Galambos, who had lectured on all continents except Antarctica, spoke on his specialty in a lecture titled, “Bonferroni-type inequalities: Fatigue failure of metals and the twin-prime conjecture”. The two lectures between Rosenthal and Galambos were by James M. Landwehr (AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories), “What should be in an introductory statistics course?” and Fred S. Roberts, “Meaningless statements”.</div>
