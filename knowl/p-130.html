<div class="para">H. H. Mitchell was born in Marietta, OH, on January 14, 1885, the son of Oscar Howard and Mary Hoadley (Hawks). His father was a well-known mathematics professor at Marietta College. Oscar Mitchell had been one of the first fellows at Johns Hopkins 1879-1882; he received his Ph.D. in 1882 for a dissertation in number theory. Oscar’s son’s middle name was his wife’s maiden name, a custom at that time for the naming of both boys and girls. The younger Mitchell attended local schools in Marietta and received a Ph.B. degree from Marietta College in 1906. (No longer in use, the notation Ph.B. is the abbreviation of the Latin expression for the Bachelor of Philosophy degree.) In 1935 Marietta College conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.</div>
