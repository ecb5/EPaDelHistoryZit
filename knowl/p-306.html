<div class="para">In spite of a dearth of talks on modern algebra, the period 1933-1941 bore witness to five invited lectures on number theory. In the first year Emory P. Starke of Rutgers University discussed binomial congruences on a level accessible to undergraduate students. Starke continued to be active in sectional affairs, serving as chairman for the year 1946-1947. Two of the section’s invited talks on number theory were delivered at the 1937 meeting at Haverford College. The one by Hans Rademacher was described above; the Rutgers mathematician H. S. Grant gave the other, on Farey series. In 1941 Richard P. Bailey of Lafayette College gave a talk whose title suggests geometry, “The problem of the square pyramid,” but instead deals with integral solutions of systems of equations based on the work of the French number theorist, F. E. A. Lucas.</div>
