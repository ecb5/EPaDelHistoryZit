<div class="para">Smail, a charter member of the Philadelphia Section, had spoken at the organizational meeting. Five years later, in 1931, he talked again at the second meeting held at Lehigh. This time it was Smailâ€™s turn to criticize calculus textbook authors, asserting that a definition due to Konrad Knopp was the only satisfactory alternative to the usual textbook definitions of infinite series. Smail proposed that the general principle of convergence be substituted in place of the usual limit definition of the convergence of infinite sequences. He also stressed the importance of the concept of summability.</div>
