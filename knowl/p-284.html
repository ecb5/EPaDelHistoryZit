<div class="para">During his lifetime Hans Rademacher presented four invited lectures at annual meetings of the Philadelphia Section, two during the period under consideration, the first at the 1937 meeting at Haverford College. A distinguished figure in analysis and analytic number theory, he chose to speak about Bernoulli numbers in his initial talk. Here he regarded the general binomial coefficient <span class="process-math">\(n\choose
j\)</span> as an integral-valued polynomial of the <span class="process-math">\(j^{th}\)</span> degree, which was then expressed as a linear combination of binomial coefficients by means of integral coefficients <span class="process-math">\(A_{q j}\)</span> . The resulting formula yielded the <span class="process-math">\((q + 1)^{th}\)</span> Bernoulli polynomial. The master number theorist used this fact to prove that the Von Staudt theorem followed as a direct consequence of a congruence property of the <span class="process-math">\(A_{q j}\text{.}\)</span>
