<em class="alert">Wayne Sensenig</em> was born in Goodville, PA, in 1879, and received his bachelors degree from Haverford College in 1901. We suspect that his father was David M. Sensenig, who taught at West Chester at the turn of the century. Wayne Sensenig was employed as an engineer until becoming a high school mathematics teacher in Philadelphia in 1912. While teaching by day he attended classes at the University of Pennsylvania by night, resulting in an A. M. degree in just two years. In 1919 he received his Ph.D. under Oliver E. Glenn. His doctoral dissertation, “Concerning the invariant theory of involutions of conics”, was published in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1919. He also published a note on definite integrals in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> the following year. Having no evidence to the contrary, we assume that Sensenig taught in high school the rest of his life.
