<div class="para">At the organizational meeting ... a request for establishing the Philadelphia Section of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-71-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> was forwarded to Secretary Cairns. His first reaction was that the name was ill-chosen, since all the other Sections were named for States, and to name a section after so small a political unit as a city, would break sound precedent. I wrote back that Pennsylvania had two natural cultural centers, one at the extreme east (Philadelphia), the other at the extreme west (Pittsburgh). One could not expect much of an attendance at either of these places, from residents near the other. Philadelphia should attract persons from Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey. Setting a new precedent might encourage the later founding of a Pittsburgh Section, attracting mathematical instructors from West Virginia and Eastern Ohio as well as from western Pennsylvania. Cairns and Slaught were not obstinate, and in December, the Section was admitted under its proposed name, subject of course to the usual provision of By-Laws, etc., and promises of good behavior.</div>
