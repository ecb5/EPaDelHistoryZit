<div class="para">By 1973 Penn’s mathematics department had received an ILI grant that provided typewriter terminals to the computer, which was a major step forward. Even though the programs still ran in “batch mode” the turnaround was hours instead of days. Eventually it became minutes. It became clear to Porter that “printer graphics” were completely inadequate for showing the mathematics he wanted to show, so he applied for, and received, an NSF grant for graphic terminals. This led him to organize, and speak at, the 1979 EPADEL spring meeting on computer graphics.</div>
