<div class="para">F. D. Murnaghan was one of the few speakers who were invited from outside the area at that time. Others who came from beyond the sectionâ€™s boundaries were Colonel R. C. Yates (U. S. Military Academy) in 1951 and Morris Kline (NYU) in 1955. Five other speakers were invited in the midst of their stays at institutions in the area, though their normal affiliations were elsewhere. Three of these positions were war related: Haskell Curry was on leave from Penn State at the Frankford Arsenal in 1942, and A. A. Bennett and D. H. Lehmer were at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, on leave from Brown in 1943 and Berkeley in 1945, respectively. We might also mention that in 1954 Ernst Snapper was a visiting professor at Princeton University from the University of Southern California and the famous A. S. Besicovitch was a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from Cambridge University in England.</div>
