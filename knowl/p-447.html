<div class="para">At the annual meeting in November 1978, the membership passed “by an overwhelming vote” an amendment to the by-laws to change the name of the section to reflect the boundary that had been in effect for 22 years. That amendment had been moved, seconded, and adopted by the Executive Committee at its meeting on April 8 of that year. Beginning with national MAA approval of the change on January 2, 1979, the section became known as the Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section – in short, EPADEL. Consequently the 23- year period covered in this chapter describes the last phase of the Philadelphia Section.</div>
