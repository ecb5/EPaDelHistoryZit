<div class="para">One panelist at the 1972 meeting at Lebanon Valley College, Charles Hofmann of LaSalle, subsequently became the section’s newsletter editor (along with his wife, Roseanne). A notable speaker at the that meeting was Haskell Curry, who had addressed the section 30 years earlier while on leave from Penn State at the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia.
