<div class="para">The section officers appointed a committee to study the matter, with Walter Lawton (of Temple) as chairman, and Truman Koehler (Muhlenberg), G. Cuthbert Webber (Delaware), Donald Western (F &amp; M), and E. R. Mullins, Jr. (a high school teacher) as committee members. The secretary’s report from the 1959 meeting notes only, “Professor Lawton reported on the progress of the High School contest conducted in the Philadelphia area.” No further details were forthcoming. Yet by 1976 the section’s newsletter was informing its readership that 550 students from the Philadelphia area were among the 350,000 students nationwide who took the 80-minute, multiple-choice exam in March of that year.</div>
