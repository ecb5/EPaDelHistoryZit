<div class="para">The discussion in the preceding paragraph raises the question, “Who has delivered the most talks to the section?” Of those who accepted invitations to lecture during the period of establishment, Marguerite Lehr delivered the most, one per decade: 1931, 1944, 1954, and 1963. James Shohat comes next, having delivered all three of his talks in one decade: 1930, 1934, and 1939. Overall, Lehigh University’s Albert Wilansky gave the most lectures, five. In addition to Lehr, four other mathematicians spoke to the section on four different occasions: Cletus Oakley from Haverford College, and Hans Rademacher, Isaac Schoenberg, and Herb Wilf from the University of Pennsylvania.</div>
