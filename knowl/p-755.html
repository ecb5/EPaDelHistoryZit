<div class="para">But it was the afternoon session that fulfilled Stromquist’s promise. He wrote, “We are experimenting with a somewhat different format, in order to allow attendees to sit at the keyboards and work directly with several of the most promising interactive systems.” Four 20-minute presentations demonstrated the systems Stromquist mentioned: Charles E. Hofmann (LaSalle) and Roseanne S. Hofmann (Montgomery CCC), “Explorations in mathematics using MathKit,” Jack R. Stodghill and Barry A. Tesman (both from Dickinson), “Mathematica- based labs for calculus I, II, and III,” David R. Hill (Temple) and Gerald J. Porter (Penn), “Interactive linear algebra in MathCAD,” and Charles E. Ashley (Villanova), “Maple projects for differential equations and linear algebra”. Two types of parallel sessions were conducted during these presentations – a 90- minute student-paper session organized by Linda C. Thiel (Ursinus), and a series of interactive demonstrations on MathKit, Mathematica, MathCAD, and Maple.</div>
