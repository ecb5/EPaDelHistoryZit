<div class="para">The section met in New Jersey for the last time in 1954. The meeting hosted by Princeton University is noteworthy for another reason – attendance exceeded 100 for the first time in the section’s history. The Philadelphia Section sponsored no more meetings in New Jersey after 1955 due to the formation of two other MAA sections. In 1941 the Metropolitan New York Section had been carved out of the existing Upper New York State Section, with boundaries including the part of New Jersey north of New Brunswick. However, by the mid-1950s two developments prompted the desire for a New Jersey Section: a committee formed to improve articulation between colleges and secondary schools in the state, and the emerging role of mathematicians within the College Entrance Examination Board, located in Princeton. Due to the efforts of two individuals who had been active in our section up to that time, Dean Albert E. Meder of Rutgers and Albert W. Tucker of Princeton, the New Jersey Section met for the first time on November 3, 1956, at Rutgers. From that time onward any MAA member who lived in New Jersey became a member of the new section unless another preference was indicated. The by-laws of the New Jersey Section have been lauded for attention to detail, with most of the credit going to our section’s former chairman, Cyril A. Nelson. Nelson’s affiliation was listed as Douglass College of Rutgers University, the name given to the former New Jersey College for Women in 1955 in honor of its first dean, Mabel Smith Douglass.</div>
