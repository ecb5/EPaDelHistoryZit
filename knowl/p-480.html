<div class="para">One of the special activities planted in 1974 began to sprout buds the following year, when minutes from an Executive Committee meeting stated, “We agreed to try to get a Newsletter going in the near future. Dorothy Wolfe will make the editing attempt and Phil Bedient will look into the production problem.” A lack of sufficient finances caused a delay in appearance, but the first section newsletter was published in February 1976 with Dorothy Wolfe (Widener) as editor. Since that time the newsletter has become the section’s primary source of communication, especially because, as we will see in <a href="EPADEL.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: EPADEL, 1979-2000">Chapter 7</a>, by about 1980 the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> discontinued the practice of publishing sectional reports. For now we relate two items about the national MAA that appeared in the second newsletter (published in October 1976). In that issue the section’s governor, David Rosen, wrote, “You will also be interested to know that the 1978 January meeting has been moved to January 6-8 ... the usual late January meeting time has become inconvenient for many schools.”</div>
