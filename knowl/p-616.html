<div class="para">In January 1989 the national MAA inaugurated a program of student chapters that has proved to be immensely successful in our section. The official notification read, “The Board of Governors of the MAA has approved a plan to develop Student Chapters for the purpose of attracting students to careers in the mathematical sciences. MAA Student Chapters will be formed at individual institutions, and the members of the Student Chapters will be regarded as members of the MAA section associated with their institution.” The MAA envisaged chapter activities to include films, speakers, mini-courses, and career information. Our section served as a model for others right from the start. No wonder – the national coordinator of the program was Howard Anton (then at Drexel), the former EPADEL president.</div>
