<div class="para">Chapter 6 noted the section’s interest in computers as early as 1970, when it sponsored a panel discussion on their place in the mathematics curriculum. This interest intensified in the present period, which featured eight lectures on topics related directly to <dfn class="terminology">computer science</dfn>. Two of these talks were given by individuals with ties to Temple University. In 1987 Elaine Jacobson, a Ph.D. graduate of Temple then employed by Control Data Corporation, spoke about “Parallel processing architectures”. Twelve years later, Temple faculty member Doron Zeilberger spoke about the role of computing in the future in a lecture that carried the unusual title, “Synopses of two textbooks: Levi Ben Gerson’s Ma’asei Khoshev (ca. 1320) and Shalosh B. Ekhad’s Plane Geometry (ca. 2050).”</div>
