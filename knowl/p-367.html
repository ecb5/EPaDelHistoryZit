<div class="para">As mentioned above, Alice T. Schafer received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1942. Her dissertation on projective differential geometry was written under department head Ernest P. Lane. She taught at Swarthmore and Drexel, as well as several other institutions, before joining the faculty of Wellesley College. She retired from there in 1980 as the Helen Day Gould Professor of Mathematics, but after her husbandâ€™s retirement the couple moved to Virginia, where she became a professor at Marymount University. She retired a second time in 1996. The MAA bestowed its Distinguished Service to Mathematics award on her in 1998.</div>
