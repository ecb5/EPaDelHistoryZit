<div class="para">The report from 1954 provides the first mention of a governor. Initially a Board of Trustees administered the national MAA, with 12 of its members being elected at large. In 1939 these elected members were designated as governors and a Board of Governors replaced the Board of Trustees. Both boards included the Association’s officers. The 1939 national by-laws stated that there would be 14 governors elected biennially by regions. Just six years later these unwieldy regions were eliminated in favor of one governor from each section of the MAA. We defer discussion of the section’s governors until <a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">Chapter 6</a>.</div>
