<div class="para">The second column in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table13.html" title="Table 6.1.1: ">Table 6.1.1</a> lists the locations of the 23 meetings. Whereas in earlier periods the University of Pennsylvania dominated the sites of the annual meetings, none was held at Penn from 1955 to 1997. Similarly, Lehigh University, the other focus in our elliptical model for the founding of the section, hosted only one in the 23-year period, in 1958. Lehigh hosted four meetings before this period but would not host another for 40 more years. The examples of Penn and Lehigh suggest that beginning in the mid-1950s the section’s leadership decentralized from these two research universities to other colleges and universities scattered throughout the region. This change in the nature of our local section is undoubtedly related to the rapid expansion of faculties in departments of mathematics in many colleges and universities throughout the country at the time.</div>
