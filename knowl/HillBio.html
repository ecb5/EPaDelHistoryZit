<dfn class="terminology">David Ross Hill</dfn> is a native of Homestead, PA, who received a B.S. degree in education from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and an M.A. in mathematics from the State University of New York at Buffalo two years later. He spent the year 1966-1967 as a computer analyst with Koppers Corp. in Pittsburgh before entering the graduate program at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received his Ph.D. in 1973. His dissertation on numerical solutions of delay differential equations was written under the supervision of George D. Byrne. Hill joined the faculty at Pittsburgh as an associate instructor during the last two years of graduate school. Upon receiving his doctorate he accepted an assistant professorship at Temple University, where he has been since, except for a visiting position at the College of the Virgin Islands in 1980. During his tenure he directed two masters theses. Hill has been a principal investigator on three major grants – two from the NSF (one with D. Zitarelli established linear algebra as a lab course in 1990) and one from FIPSE (to produce an interactive text for linear algebra with G. Porter). In 1988 Hill presented a mini-course on MATLAB at the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-178-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> summer meeting in Providence, R.I, and in 1995 he delivered a one-hour invited address at the annual MAA meeting on teaching linear algebra with technology. In addition to talks at the EPADEL spring meetings in 1986 and 1995, he has been an invited lecturer in Holland, England, and the Czech Republic. He also taught a short course at Messiah College sponsored by EPADEL in 1990. His expertise in teaching with computers led him to conduct numerous workshops – at the Northeastern Section of the MAA in 1994, the MAA MathFest in Seattle in 1996, and the NSF-sponsored ATLAST Project from 1992 through 1996. Hill is the author of several successful textbooks, including three with Bernard Kolman. In addition, he was the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching Award at Temple in 1996.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#HillBio" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
