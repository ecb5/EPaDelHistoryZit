<div class="para">We provide sketches of the other two secretary-treasurers below, but first we note that both of them have been particularly effective in their role as treasurer. In 1983 the section received a letter from Alfred B. Willcox at the national MAA indicating that the remission of $120 to the national office by treasurer Jim Brooks was “extraordinary.” Willcox added, “Aid to sections is available ... If the fortunes of EPADEL should take a turn for the worse, you might keep this in mind.” Although the section’s finances continued to run in the black, the treasurer’s report to the Executive Committee at the meeting held September 1984 came with a caveat: “Our current bank balance is $578. We need to be careful about expenditures.” Subsequent treasurers carried on the tradition of careful expenditures, and in Cliff Wagner’s final account to the Executive Committee he reported a balance of over $13,000.</div>
