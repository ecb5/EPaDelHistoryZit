<div class="para">Five of the papers delivered during this period dealt with number theory, two of which dealt with continued fractions: G. C. Webber (1943), “Transcendality of certain continued fractions,” and V. F. Cowling (1947), “Convergence criteria for continued fractions”. Cowling taught at Lehigh from 1949 to 1961 before moving to the University of Kentucky. One of his first doctoral students there, Jerry King, has been extremely active in the section since coming to Lehigh in 1962 with a newly minted Ph.D.</div>
