<p><em class="alert">Lisa Marano</em> <aside class="aside aside-like"><p>Ph.D. Adviser:       Vladimir Dobric</p>
<p>Dissertation Title: <span class="booktitle">On the Global and Local Moduli of Continuity of Brownian Motion</span></p></aside> earned her BA in Mathematics and Secondary Education at Rider College in <span class="process-math">\(1995\)</span> , and her MS and Ph.D. in Mathematics at Lehigh University in <span class="process-math">\(1997\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2002\text{,}\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>Originally from Camden NJ, Lisa first became a member of EPADEL while in graduate school in the late 1990s. She served as the Section NExT Coordinator from 2004 to 2007, as a Member-at-large of the Executive Board, as Vice President and then President from 2007 to 2011 and finally as Section Governor from 2016 to 2018.</p>
<p>Lisa has the dubious distinction of having been both the section's last President and the last Governor because during the time she held each office the names were changed to Chair, and Section Representative, respectively.</p>
<p>Lisa joined West Chester University in 2002 as an Assistant Professor. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2008, and to Professor in 2016. She has served as the Associate Dean for the College of this Sciences and Mathematics since 2021.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#Marano" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
