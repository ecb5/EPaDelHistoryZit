<em class="alert">Rollin Landis Charles</em> (1885-1941), a mathematical physicist born in Bethlehem, PA, was associated with three institutions in the Philadelphia Section. He obtained two degrees at Lehigh University – an A.B. in 1907 and an A.M. in <span class="process-math">\(1910\text{.}\)</span> He pursued additional courses at Lehigh, Columbia, and Penn. Charles began teaching at Lehigh as an instructor in physics in the fall after taking his undergraduate degree, the position he held when he became a charter member of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-79-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> in <span class="process-math">\(1916\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(1922\)</span> he moved to Franklin &amp; Marshall College as professor of physics and applied electricity, the position he held at the time of the founding of the Philadelphia Section.  Charles remained at F &amp; M until his death at age <span class="process-math">\(56\text{.}\)</span> In the meantime he was also a professor at Albright College in Reading, PA, from <span class="process-math">\(1928\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1930\text{.}\)</span> He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  He was also a member of several other organizations, including the American Philatelic Society, Sons of the Revolution, and the Pennsylvania German Society.</div></li>

<em class="alert">Victor H. Doushkess</em> (1895-1966) received a B. S. degree at Lehigh University in 1917. He enrolled in the graduate program at Lafayette College two years later, receiving an A. M. degree in 1921. Doushkess was appointed an instructor at Lafayette in 1919 and was promoted to assistant professor five years later. He remained at Lafayette until 1935.</div></li>

<em class="alert">Morris Samuel Knebelman</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1890-1972\)</span>) was born in Russia. After coming to the U.S., he received a B.S. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1912 and an M.S. from Lehigh University in <span class="process-math">\(1914\text{.}\)</span> During his second year at Lehigh he was appointed an instructor. In <span class="process-math">\(1925\)</span> he enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1928\)</span> for a dissertation on differential geometry written under two notable advisors, Oswald Veblen and Luther Eisenhart. Knebelman served as an instructor at Princeton while completing his degree, and he remained there the next year on a National Research Council Fellowship. Due to the sudden death of a faculty member in the summer of <span class="process-math">\(1929\text{,}\)</span> Princeton had the dire need for someone to head the university’s mathematics courses for engineers. Knebelman’s background at Lehigh made him a suitable candidate, so he was offered the position of assistant professor. He continued in this capacity until 1939, when he became a professor and head of the department at Washington State University. He later became Dean of the Graduate School at Washington. Knebelman taught there until <span class="process-math">\(1965\)</span> when, at age <span class="process-math">\(74\text{,}\)</span> he returned east as a visiting professor at Bucknell University. He died in Lewisburg in <span class="process-math">\(1972\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(82\text{.}\)</span>

<em class="alert">William Franklin Long</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1871-1945\)</span>) was an astronomer who was born in Boyertown, PA. He graduated from Kutztown State Normal School in <span class="process-math">\(1891\text{,}\)</span> earned his bachelors degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in <span class="process-math">\(1897\text{,}\)</span> and did graduate work at Cornell, Harvard, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Columbia.  In <span class="process-math">\(1942\)</span> F&amp;M bestowed on him an honorary degree of Doctor of Science.  Long taught in high schools in Johnstown and Pittsburgh from the time of his graduation from F&amp;M until <span class="process-math">\(1918\text{.}\)</span> He was also a principal during that time. In <span class="process-math">\(1918\text{,}\)</span> Long accepted a professorship of astronomy and mathematics at his alma mater, and remained there for the next <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> years. A newspaper clipping states, “he was known by ‘thousands of Lancastrians’ as the director of the Scholl Observatory.” Long retired in June <span class="process-math">\(1944\text{,}\)</span> yet he taught an evening astronomy course in the fall of <span class="process-math">\(1944\text{.}\)</span> He died on New Year’s Day <span class="process-math">\(1945\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(73\text{.}\)</span>
