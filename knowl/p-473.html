<div class="para">The 1967 meeting was the first at which the section recognized its top performers on the Putnam Competition. Each was awarded a yearâ€™s membership in the MAA. The report from that meeting states that all three winners hailed from Swarthmore, but unfortunately it does not name them. Names of Putnam awardees were provided at every meeting up to 1976, but no such reports appeared thereafter.</div>
