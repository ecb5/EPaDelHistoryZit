<div class="para">Overall, EPADEL members delivered 28 of the 81 lectures. One notable pairing is the duo of Herbert S. Wilf and Doron Zeilberger, whose work on the eponymous WZ-method earned them the prestigious Steele Prize in 1998 for seminal contributions to research. Also of local interest is the fact that the first African-American invited to deliver an address is an EPADEL member. However, Shiferaw Berhanu (Temple) was unable speak at the 1991 meeting due to illness. Robert S. Smith (Miami of Ohio) thus became the first African- American speaker four years later. To draw a longtime EPADEL connection, Smith received his Penn State Ph.D. in 1969 under Orrin Frink, who had spoke to the section in 1928 and 1932.</div>
