<div class="para">The 1945 meeting thus serves as a dividing line between wartime activities and the period that followed. Although only 27 people attended the meeting in 1944, 44 attended in 1945 and 51 in 1946. All were held at the University of Pennsylvania. The 1945 program consisted of only three lectures, but the presenters were all outstanding mathematicians. One was Ralph Fox of Princeton University, who spoke about homotopy groups. One was Antoni Zygmund, then at Penn but soon to be enticed to the University of Chicago by Marshall Stone; Zygmund spoke on his specialty, trigonometric series. The remaining speaker was Derrick H. Lehmer, who taught at Lehigh University from 1934 to 1940 and spoke to the section in 1939. For the record, D. H. Lehmer’s father was the mathematician Derrick N. Lehmer, a 1900 Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Our Lehmer produced only two Ph.D. students, both at Berkeley, but his two students are household names today and both have been extremely active with the MAA – Tom Apostol and Ronald Graham.</div>
