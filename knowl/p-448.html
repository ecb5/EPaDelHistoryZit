<div class="para">As usual, the chapter begins with an examination of all annual meetings held during the period: attendance, dates, and locations. We discuss how the first two elements are intimately intertwined. In this chapter the examination of meetings is not followed directly by a discussion of the section’s leadership. Instead, we describe a whole raft of new activities that were instituted, including high-school contests, a committee on teaching standards, a newsletter, a panel on industrial opportunities, sessions of undergraduate speakers, results from competitions, films, special interest groups, and, most notably, the restructuring of the section’s governance.</div>
