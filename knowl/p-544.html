<div class="para">What caused the sudden upsurge of interest in topology? Two of the section’s leaders were perhaps responsible – William Pervin and Albert Wilansky. Wilansky spoke twice (in 1963 and 1970), Pervin once (1967). Besides, three MAA officers, all prominent members of the R. L. Moore School of Topology at Texas, accepted invitations address the section: R. L. Bing, Raymond Wilder, and Gail Young. None dealt with the logical relations among axioms popularized by their famous mentor. Instead Bing’s title was “Homogeneity,” Wilder’s “Intuition” (probably in algebraic geometry), and Young’s “Topological methods in analysis”. The section also heard Edwin Moise speak twice on knot theory. William Thurston delivered a notable lecture on topology titled simply “Symmetry”.</div>
