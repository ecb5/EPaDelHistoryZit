<div class="para">Albert Arnold Bennett was born on June 2, 1888, in Yokohama, Japan. His parents, Albert Arnold and Mela Isabelle (Barrows), were missionaries in Japan at the time. The younger Albert Bennett returned to Providence in 1902 to live with relatives so he could complete his high-school education and prepare for college. He excelled in school, earning two degrees from Brown University, an A.B. in 1910 and an Sc. M. in 1911 (based primarily on a thesis he had written the preceding year).</div>
