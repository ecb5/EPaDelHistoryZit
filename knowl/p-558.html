<div class="para">Overall, this discussion shows that most of the activities that took place at annual meetings from 1956 to 1978 centered on educational issues, as evidenced by both panel discussions and invited lectures. Among the invited lectures, the categories of analysis and topology/geometry garnered the greatest number of speakers, although an increasing number were concerned with algebra, applications, and combinatorics/graph theory. Talks in algebra considered mainstream topics for the first time, while the applications were varied and unrelated to war projects.</div>
