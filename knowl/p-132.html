<div class="para">Upon graduation from Princeton, Mitchell was appointed an instructor in mathematics at the famous Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. However, he remained at Yale only one year before accepting the same position at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught for the rest of his life. Altogether he supervised five Ph.D. dissertations with topics ranging from finite group theory to Galois fields and cyclotomic field extensions. His most well known student was probably Leonard Carlitz (Ph.D. 1930), who spent a very productive career at Duke University.</div>
