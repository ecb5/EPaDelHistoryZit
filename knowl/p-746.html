<div class="para">The presentation by Klotz and Schattschneider was followed by a computer- animated video by Eiji Hirai from Swarthmore College, and two lectures, the first by Cynthia Schmatzried on “The relationship of pre-college math to college mathematics: What should we be teaching secondary teachers?” and the second by Ann Fetter and Cynthia Schmatzried on “Hands-on models”. The final part of the morning session was a demonstration of The Geometer’s Sketchpad by its developers, Nicholas Jackiw and Eugene Klotz. The Geometer’s Sketchpad has been highly successful and is currently available commercially from Key Curriculum Press. (Incidentally, Key Curriculum’s president, Steven Rasmussen, holds two Temple degrees, a B.A. in mathematics in 1976 and a masters degree in mathematics education in 1978.)</div>
