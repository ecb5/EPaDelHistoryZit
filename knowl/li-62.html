He received a B.A. from Temple University in 1936, followed by two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania: A.M. 1939 and Ph.D. 1946 (under Antoni Zygmund). N. J. Fine studied for his doctorate while teaching high school for one year, teaching college (Cornell and Purdue) for three years, and being a research mathematician at both the Naval Ordnance Plant in Indiana and the Operations Evaluation Group in Washington, DC.
