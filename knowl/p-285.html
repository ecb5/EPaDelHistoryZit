<div class="para">Rademacher delivered his second invited lecture to the Section at the 1940 annual meeting at his home institution, the University of Pennsylvania. On this occasion he spoke about one of his favorite topics, Dedekind sums, based on a forthcoming paper written with his first Ph.D. student at Penn, Albert Whitman. Rademacher lectured on an arithmetical property of Dedekind sums called the “theorem of reciprocity”.</div>
