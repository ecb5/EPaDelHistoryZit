<div class="para">Five of the lectures do not fit into any category yet are deserving of mention because they celebrated mathematics for its own sake. Three were delivered at the 1963 meeting: C. K. Brown, “The search for delightful results,” Marguerite Lehr, “A little mathematics of the multiplication table variety,” and Pincus Schub, “Some mathematical crumbs”. Lehr’s lecture was the fourth she gave to the section, 31 years after her initial talk in 1932. She also spoke in 1944 and 1954. We already mentioned Mordell’s 1969 talk titled “Reminiscences”. We end with the delightful title of a lecture delivered in 1971 by longtime MAA Executive Director Alfred B. Willcox, “England was lost on the playing fields of Eton: A parable for mathematics”.</div>
