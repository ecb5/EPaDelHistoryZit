<div class="para">Clearly Bennett’s star was rising. He had begun his professional career by remaining at Princeton as an instructor from 1914 to 1916. However, he left the east in the fall of 1916 to accept a position as adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Austin, where he remained for nine years. Although 26 years old when he moved to Texas, patriotism compelled him to enroll in the country’s first Officer’s Training College. As a result he was sent to Leon Springs, Texas, and later to Fort Monroe, Virginia. On August 15, 1917, he was commissioned as a Captain in C.A.R.C. but it appears that throughout World War I he remained stationed in the States. The following June, Bennett was transferred to the Ordnance Corps, where he served in Oswald Veblen’s ballistics research staff at Aberdeen Proving Ground with Gilbert Bliss and Norbert Wiener.</div>
