<div class="para">During the five-year period under discussion the section sponsored three lectures on standard topics from applied mathematics: astronomy, mechanics, and potential theory. In 1928 Swarthmore’s John Miller spoke about his first love, mathematical astronomy. He suggested a way of explaining solar coronas by considering particles ejected from the solar surface at successive intervals. In his lecture Miller proposed a theory based on conic sections and orthogonal projections of planes. He concluded, “This theory has been applied to a great many solar coronas that have been photographed in the past twenty years with long focus telescopes ... Of course this does not prove that the coronas are produced in this way but it does offer one explanation of their peculiarities.” At the 1929 meeting, one year after Miller’s talk, charter member Kenneth Lamson of Lehigh University presented an invited lecture on experiments that led to the use of quantum theory. He described the work of the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger leading to the conclusion that energy in mechanics corresponds to frequency in optics. Here, the Philadelphia Section was being kept abreast of current research being conducted in Europe. Another Lehigh faculty member, George E. Raynor, spoke about potential theory in his 1932 talk to open the meeting at Swarthmore College. In the first part he described recent progress on the Dirichlet problem. In the second he supplied necessary and sufficient conditions for the Dirichlet-Neumann problem to have a solution for a sphere with a singular point at the center.</div>
