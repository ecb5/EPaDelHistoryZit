<em class="alert">Carl Barnett Allendoerfer</em> (1911-1974) graduated from Haverford College in 1932, after which he held a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to Cambridge University before receiving his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1937. Allendoerfer joined the faculty at his alma mater Haverford College in 1946 but stayed there only five years, one of which (1948-1949) was spent at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He then went to the University of Washington, where he became one of the most active members of the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-168-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>, serving as President for 1959-1960.

<em class="alert">Heinrich Wilhelm Brinkmann</em> (1898-1989) was born in Hanover, Germany. Heine Brinkmann received all his higher education in the U.S. and ultimately became a naturalized citizen. He earned a bachelors degree from Stanford University in 1920 and then accepted an instructorship there for a year. During this period he was strongly interested in group theory by Hans Blichfeldt, and he helped W. A. Manning write his book Primitive Groups. During the summer of 1922 G. D. Birkhoff became Stanford’s first visiting professor. He met Brinkmann and prompted him to apply to Harvard for graduate school. When the prestigious university officially offered Brinkmann admission to the graduate program later that year, he replied with a terse telegraph message, “Yes.” He earned a masters degree in 1923 and a Ph.D. in 1925, while holding a Sheldon Fellowship during 1923- 1924. He wrote his dissertation on Riemann spaces under Birkhoff. After graduation, Brinkmann spent a post-doctoral year with Emmy Noether at Göttingen before returning to Harvard as a faculty member. He was a very popular teacher; 50 years later his former student J. L. Brenner recalled, “Brinkmann’s classes were among the most brilliantly organized ... he raised questions in just the right way.” In 1933 Brinkmann moved to Swarthmore College, where he remained for the rest of his life. He held the College’s Magill Professorship from 1957 to 1965 and the Buffington Professorship from 1965 until his retirement four years later. In 1971 he and future section chair Eugene Klotz published the book Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry. Like several Swarthmore mathematicians, Brinkmann played musical instruments. He became one of the most active mathematicians in the Philadelphia Section during the 1930s, serving a record four terms on the Program Committee. He also delivered invited lectures at annual meetings in 1933, 1941, and 1955. Heine Brinkmann died at age 90 in nearby Wallingford.</div></li>
