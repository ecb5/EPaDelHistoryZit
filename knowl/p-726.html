<div class="para">The meeting began with welcoming remarks by Leonard Holder, the dean of the college and former chair of the mathematics department. Next came a panel discussion on the question, “What do we mean by mathematical modeling?” Moderated by Jerry King (Lehigh), the panelists were Fred Roberts (Rutgers) and Gerald Thompson (Carnegie-Mellon). The two panelists delivered invited lectures after that. Before lunch Thompson spoke on “Combinatorial decision – Problem applications and solutions.” After the meal Roberts described “Interval graphs, traffic lights, and ecological phase space”. Samuel Merrill (Wilkes) followed that with a third invited lecture, “Citizen voting power under the Electoral College system.” The day ended with another panel discussion, this one devoted to “Experiences in the teaching of courses on mathematical modeling.” Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore) was the moderator, while Gene D. Chase (Messiah) and Randall King (Gettysburg) were the panelists.</div>
