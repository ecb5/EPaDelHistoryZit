<div class="para">President Douglas Ensley promised that the 2000 meeting would extend beyond local success stories. He wrote, “The meeting features speakers known nationally through the MAA.” One of the renowned speakers was Laurie Snell, known primarily for his 1950s pioneering work in developing (with John G. Kemeny and Gerald Thompson) the now-standard finite mathematics course and writing the first book on the subject. In his talk Snell discussed his more recent interest, Chance News, an electronic newsletter dealing with current news based on probability and statistics. In the remaining talk, “Applications of MAPLE in the instruction of probability and statistics”, Elliot A. Tanis (Hope College) discussed ways to integrate the Computer Algebra System MAPLE into the instruction of probability and statistics. He also illustrated some procedures that helped to complete the statistical package in MAPLE.</div>
