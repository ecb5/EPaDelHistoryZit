<section class="paragraphs"><div class="para">The Mathematical Association of America (<a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>) is the world’s largest organization devoted to the interests of collegiate mathematics, with a major emphasis on the teaching of mathematics at the collegiate level. The <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> is different from many professional mathematical organizations in one vital respect – more activity takes place within its sections than at its national meetings.</div> <div class="para">This work chronicles the history of one of those sections during its first 75 years. <a href="Background.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Background">Chapter 1</a> provides a background to the establishment of the section by outlining the formation of the two major mathematical organizations in the country and their sections – the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> and the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS (American Mathematical Society)</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>. <a href="Founding.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Founding">Chapter 2</a> discusses the founding of the Philadelphia Section in November 1926. The Section initially included all of central Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. The next four chapters describe the development of the section into periods defined by external events. The first, 1926-1933, ends with the founding of the Allegheny Section. The second, 1933-1941, includes the role played by émigrés who settled in the area after fleeing their homeland to avoid persecution. The period 1941-1956 begins with wartime activities and ends with the founding of the New Jersey Section. It is followed by a period of immense expansion, 1956-1978. The present name of the section, EPADEL, adopted in late 1978, serves as a divider for the last period, 1978-2000, the focus of <a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a>. In addition, by the mid 1970s it became necessary to add a second annual meeting to the program; the final chapter describes the resulting spring meetings held annually since then.</div> <div class="para">This book has been written so all chapters can be read independently. Thus someone who is not interested in the distant past, but wants to recall activities and leaders from, say, the sixties, can jump to the corresponding chapter with impunity. On the other hand, reading the book from front to back provides a greater appreciation for the incremental changes that have taken place over the <span class="process-math">\(75\)</span>-year duration.</div> <div class="para">The emphasis of this book, however, is not strictly on the mathematical developments that took place. Rather, the strength of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> – and its sections – lies with the vast army of volunteers who march to the front line with plans of actions. Consequently this account emphasizes the people who made the section what it is. In this sense, the book attempts to bring the sectional leaders to life by interspersing biographical sketches into the narrative. Some of theses leaders have been so active – and decorated on a national scale – that larger profiles are provided at the end of chapters. Altogether 16 personalities have been profiled; 88 others have biographical sketches. Appendix 1 provides an alphabetical list of all 104 of them.</div> <div class="para">Sometimes, finding details about these personalities has presented a daunting task, because few departments have kept very good records. However, I have been helped enormously by several archivists, to whom EPADEL and I owe a great debt of gratitude: Claire L. Andrews and John A. Erdmann (Kutztown), Raymond Butti (Brown), James Duffin and Ryan M. Janda (Penn), Daniel R.  Gilbert (Moravian), Philip A. Metzger (Lehigh), Patricia O’Donnell (Swarthmore), Diana F. Peterson (Haverford), Ann W. Upton (F&amp;M), and Carolyn Weigel (Ursinus).</div> <div class="para">Many present EPADEL members have also aided me in locating information.  I will not attempt to list all of them here, partly for fear of omitting someone who spent a lot of time searching for, say, the exact year of retirement of a colleague.  However, I hereby acknowledge the invaluable help I received from a few people who are not sketched in this work: Stephen F. Andrilli (LaSalle), James P.  Crawford (Lafayette), Penelope H. Dunham (Muhlenberg), Gary L. Ebert (Delaware), Frederick W. Hartmann (Villanova), Everett Pitcher (Lehigh), Chris Rorres (Drexel), George M. Rosenstein, Jr. (F&amp; M), Jeff Tecosky-Feldman (Haverford), and Paul R. Wolfson (West Chester).</div> <div class="para">I am particularly indebted to Temple University for a Research and Study Leave during the spring <span class="process-math">\(1999\)</span> semester. This sabbatical allowed me to jumpstart a history that had been languishing the previous two years.</div> <div class="para">In addition, I gratefully thank William Dunham (Muhlenberg), for his detailed proofreading of an earlier version of the entire manuscript, and Raymond F.  Coughlin (Temple), for his encouragement to publish it.</div> <div class="para">David E.
