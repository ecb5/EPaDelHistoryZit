<div class="para">The attendance of 165 at the 1968 meeting at Drexel smashed the previous record (115 at the 1954 meeting in Princeton) but the new record would be short lived – the 225 who attended the 1970 meeting at West Chester eclipsed it. The 1969 meeting at Swarthmore was also well attended (194), but it was the program that day that deserves mention. The morning session began with a lecture by Moore School topologist Gail Young titled “Topological methods in analysis”. Next came Eric Wolman of Bell Labs who discussed applications in communication systems as “an application of topological methods”. After the audience dined in Swarthmore’s student center, the famous mathematician L. J. Mordell from Cambridge regaled the assembly with memories he titled “Reminiscences of an octogenarian mathematician”.</div>
