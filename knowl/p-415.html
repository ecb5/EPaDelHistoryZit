<div class="para">Hans Rademacher delivered the final talk on number theory in 1955, titled “Dedekind sums and classes of modular substitutions”. He had planned to lecture on this same subject when he accepted the invitation to deliver MAA’s Hedrick Lecture in 1963, but illness prevented him from giving the talk. However, his doctoral student Emil Grosswald, who would become the section’s governor 1965-1968, delivered the lecture in his place. Grosswald further memorialized Rademacher’s work in the field by editing and expanding Rademacher’s notes into the 1972 Carus Monograph <em class="emphasis">Dedekind Sums</em>.</div>
