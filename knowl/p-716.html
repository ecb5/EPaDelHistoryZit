<div class="para">About 75 people attended this special session. Its success prompted Wallace Growney to organize another special session in the fall, this one devoted to “The new applied mathematics”. The meeting on October 4 was impressive, prompting section secretary-treasurer Phillip Bedient to send a congratulatory note to Growney. It read, “By every measure that I can devise the recent Special Session on Applied Mathematics held at Rosemont College was a success. ... Since the Session was largely your doing from start to finish, the section owes you a strong expression of gratitude for a job well done.”</div>
