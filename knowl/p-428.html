<div class="para">Clearly Oxtoby was a brilliant research mathematician. He had published several papers by the time he left Harvard in 1939. Since holding a Junior Fellowship carried more prestige than writing a doctoral dissertation, Oxtoby, like the others mentioned above, never felt the need to obtain a doctorate. He accepted an assistant professorship at Bryn Mawr College in the fall of 1939, and remained there until he retired as professor emeritus 40 years later, in 1979, at age 68. Oxtoby served as the head of the department from 1948 until 1976. Imagine – 28 years! He was appointed to the College’s prestigious Class of 1897 Professorship for the last four years of his active career.</div>
