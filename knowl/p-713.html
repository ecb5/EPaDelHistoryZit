<div class="para">The impetus for holding special sessions devoted to a particular theme was a questionnaire designed by Eugene Klotz in 1973-1974 and sent to all departments in the section. As noted in <a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">ChapterÂ 6</a>, Klotz summarized the responses by listing three activities that would appeal to a wide segment of the membership. Two of them were holding special meetings and accentuating special topics at regular meetings. Joerg Mayer organized the first special session in April 1975 at his home institution, Lebanon Valley College. Mayer was then in the final leg of his second year as chair of the section. Another special session was held that October. For the next two years the two aspects of the Klotz report came together as special meetings devoted to a single topic. We examine these four sessions.</div>
