<div class="para logical"><ul class="disc"><li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Haskell Brooks Curry</dfn> (1900-1982) was David Hilbert’s last American student, receiving his Göttingen doctorate in 1930. He taught at his alma mater, Harvard, and at Princeton in the 1920s before accepting a position at Penn State in 1929. Except for World War II stints at the Frankford Arsenal (1942-1944), Applied Physics Lab (Johns Hopkins, 1944-1945), and Aberdeen Proving Ground (1945-1946), Curry spent the rest of his career at Penn State. In 1960 the University awarded him its prestigious Evan Pugh Research Professorship, which he held until his retirement six years later. Instead of remaining in State College he moved to Amsterdam as director of the Institute for Foundational Research; he retired from that post in 1970.</div></li></ul></div>
