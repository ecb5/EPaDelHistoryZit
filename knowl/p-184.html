<div class="para">The final speaker was J. A. Foberg, the Director of Science and Mathematics for Pennsylvania who had been a co-chairman of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-139-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>’s National Committee on Mathematical Requirements. In the introduction to his talk Foberg expressed his view on the section’s role in pre-college education. He stated, “The attention consistently given by the Mathematical Association to the interests of mathematical instruction in the secondary school makes it appropriate that discussion of mathematics instruction in the public schools should form part of the program of this initial meeting of the Philadelphia Section.” Foberg told the audience that “mathematics is a required study through the first nine school years – thereafter it is elective.” Nonetheless, “the state program of studies in Pennsylvania contemplates a continuous twelve-year program in such major subjects as mathematics.” His concluding remarks encouraged a symbiotic relationship between high school teachers and college professors. “A number of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania now admit applicants upon a showing of twelve units of work done in the three-year senior high school. It is hoped and expected that this plan will become general in the near future.”</div>
