</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Hugh Norton Albright</dfn> was born in Jerusalem in 1928. He received a bachelors degree from Catholic University (Washington, DC) and two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. A Christian Brother, he received his Ph.D. in 1959 for a dissertation written under Morikuni Goto titled, “Compact complex homogeneous manifolds.” Brother Albright has taught at LaSalle his whole career – a total of 44 years! – from his arrival in January 1951 until retirement in 1995. He was chairman of the mathematics department from 1964 to 1970. He was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1970 and 1971 after having served as vice-chair for two years. To add to his administrative duties at this time, he served as the Dean of Arts and Sciences at LaSalle from 1970 to 1976. When asked how he handled 12 straight years of university administration Brother Albright responded, “I attended Saturday classes at the University of the Arts for three hours every week for eight semesters, from 1977 to 1980, to help me overcome the experience.” Although he retired from full-time teaching in 1995, he has continued teaching part-time at LaSalle since then.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-76" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
