<div class="para">EPADEL played an active role in promoting the professional development of women and minorities. The Philadelphia Region of Women and Mathematics (WAM) has been coordinated since 1986 primarily by Gloria Dion (at Penn State â€“ Ogontz and the Educational Testing Service). The major aim of WAM, initially funded by an IBM grant, was to encourage girls to continue their study of mathematics throughout high school by providing speakers who worked in fields that used mathematics or statistics. Along these lines it should be mentioned that Regina Brunner (Cedar Crest College) conducted a series of annual MathConns at her home institution throughout the 1990s to celebrate Mathematics Awareness Day for seventh- and eighth-grade girls and their teachers.</div>
