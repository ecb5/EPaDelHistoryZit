<div class="para">The correspondence between Kline and Moore does not seem to address the origin of the famous Moore Method of teaching. More than likely, Moore’s techniques evolved over time, as evidenced by course descriptions in the course catalogs at Penn and his influence on fellow faculty members (particularly EPADEL founder H. H. Mitchell). Besides, the dissertation topics of Moore’s Ph.D. students at Texas in the 1920s were similar to Kline’s and to Moore’s other two Penn students, George H. Hallett, Jr. (1918) and Anna Mullikin (1922). Knowing how Moore directed his students from basic axiomatic systems to doctoral dissertations, it seems clear that the first person to benefit from the Moore Method was J. R. Kline.</div>
