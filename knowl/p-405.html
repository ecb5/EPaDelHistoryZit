<div class="para">Eleven talks were devoted to either geometry or topology during the period 1942-1955, seven of which dealt primarily with topology itself. Alexander Doniphan Wallace, who taught at Penn 1941-1947 before going to Tulane and Florida, opened the 1943 meeting with a lecture on “Fixed point theorems”. In his talk Wallace applied Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem to a surprising realm, the theory of matrices. Two years later Wallace’s colleague, W. H. Gottschalk, known for his book on topological dynamics, spoke on “Continuous flows and AP functions”. Here AP stands for almost periodic.</div>
