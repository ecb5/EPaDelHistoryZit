<div class="para">As noted in <a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">ChapterÂ 6</a>, student talks made their way onto the program for the first time in 1962 but they occurred only irregularly after that. However, these student talks became a staple at both the fall and spring meetings under Deb Frantz and they have continued under Linda Thiel (Ursinus and SIAM), who assumed the coordinator position for student talks in 1995.</div>
