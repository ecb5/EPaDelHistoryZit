</h3> <dfn class="terminology">William Joseph Pervin</dfn> is a Pittsburgh native, born there in 1930. He received two degrees from the University of Michigan in 1952, a B.S. and an M.S., and a Ph.D. five years later from the University of Pittsburgh for a dissertation written under Norman Levine. While in graduate school at Pitt he was employed by the Atomic Power Division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a senior scientist (1954-1955) and also by Pitt as an assistant professor (1955-1957). Upon receiving his doctorate in 1957 he accepted a position at Penn State, where he remained until 1964 except for a year at Heidelberg University as visiting professor. He then became chair of the department at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee for three years before moving to Drexel University in 1967. He directed doctoral theses at Penn State and Wisconsin. William J. Pervin participated in the section as soon as he came to the area, delivering an invited address at the November 1967 annual meeting on “Algebraic topology for undergraduates”. When he was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1972, he was in the midst of a two-year stint as Director of the Computing Center at Drexel. Pervin was the section’s last chair to hold the position for only one year. He has worn various mantels at the University of Texas at Dallas since leaving Drexel in 1973, mostly in computing. However, Pervin steadfastly maintained his professorship in the department of mathematics and computer science, serving as chair of the department from 1983 to 1985 and master of the Engineering School (1987-1994). He resides in Richardson, Texas, with his wife and 12-year-old daughter.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-77" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
