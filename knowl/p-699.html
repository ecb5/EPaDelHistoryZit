<div class="para">Three lectures were devoted to <dfn class="terminology">probability/statistics</dfn> in this period, although one of them was a hybrid. As the title “Probability and the approximation of continuous functions” suggests, the lecture delivered by former EPADEL governor Jerry King of Lehigh in 1981 contained as much analysis as probability. The invited lecture by Mary Gray (American University) carried the fetching title, “Justice by lot: Olympic gold medals, Rwandan prisoners and employment discrimination”. Gray had been one of the founders of the Association for Women in Mathematics. The remaining talk in this category was special too. Recall that Shif Berhanu had to cancel his talk due to illness. On almost no notice, Alan J. Rossman (Dickinson) prepared a lecture with another alluring title, “Bayesian statistics in the courtroom”. The section chair at the time, Walter Stromquist, has called Rossman a hero for his duty beyond the call of service.</div>
