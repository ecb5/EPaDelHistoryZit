<div class="para">The emphasis of this book, however, is not strictly on the mathematical developments that took place. Rather, the strength of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> – and its sections – lies with the vast army of volunteers who march to the front line with plans of actions. Consequently this account emphasizes the people who made the section what it is. In this sense, the book attempts to bring the sectional leaders to life by interspersing biographical sketches into the narrative. Some of theses leaders have been so active – and decorated on a national scale – that larger profiles are provided at the end of chapters. Altogether 16 personalities have been profiled; 88 others have biographical sketches. Appendix 1 provides an alphabetical list of all 104 of them.</div>
