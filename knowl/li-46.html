He received his A.B. degree from Midland College (Kansas) in 1914 and his A.M. from the University of Kansas in 1916. He enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton University for the year 1916-1917 before transferring to the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1919 without an official supervisor. Nelson taught at three different colleges before accepting a position in 1927 at the New Jersey College for Women, which was founded in 1918 and later became affiliated with Rutgers University. He remained at Rutgers until his retirement in 1959. He died in 1984 at the age of 90.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-46" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
