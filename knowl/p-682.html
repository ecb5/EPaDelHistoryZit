<div class="para">The talks in the <dfn class="terminology">algebra/number</dfn> theory category were almost evenly divided between the two subjects. The second lecture in the present period, presented in 1979 by local algebraist Willard Baxter, was titled “Rings with involution - An overview”. The two lectures on algebra presented four years later were both notable, one because of a local connection, with topologist/analyst Albert Wilansky describing “What matrices can do”. Wilansky followed Yale’s Walter Feit, who discussed the history and future prospects for completing the classification of the finite simple groups. The next lecture on algebra did not occur until 1996, when two more were given, including EPADEL member Gary Gordon’s “Using symmetry in teaching group theory”.</div>
