<div class="para">At that same meeting Albert G. Rau, the Dean at Moravian College, presented his research on the history of the curriculum at Moravian secondary schools and at Moravian College. He indicated that teachers in the Moravian schools were acquainted with algebra and geometry; these subjects became part of the curriculum after 1780. This background enabled Moravian College to add conic sections into the curriculum after 1820. Analytic geometry and calculus were added after 1860 but were discontinued from about 1870 until 1900, perhaps due to the growing tradition at some Lehigh Valley colleges of students burning their calculus books at the end of the year. Rau concluded his paper by stating, “The general question of mathematics in other Pennsylvania German schools can not be examined for lack of evidence and is postponed for a later paper.” We do not know if Dean Rau ever pursued his research further in this direction, but we pause to introduce this active member of our section.</div>
