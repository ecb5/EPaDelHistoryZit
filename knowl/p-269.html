<div class="para">Membership on the Program Committee came from colleges and universities located in the city of Philadelphia, its environs, the Lehigh Valley, and New Jersey, but it did not include representation from Delaware or the northern or western part of the section’s geographical boundaries. Altogether 15 different individuals served the 26 terms in this period. The suburban Philadelphia area dominated membership on the Committee, with 12 terms (46%): Swarthmore College’s three members served six terms (Brinkmann four; Dresden and Wilson one each), Haverford College’s two members served three terms (Oakley two, Allendoerfer one), while Ursinus College’s Clawson served two terms and Bryn Mawr’s Hedlund served one. The Lehigh Valley came next in representation, with 6 terms (23%): Lehigh University provided three terms (Fort two and Lehmer one) and so did Lafayette College (Smith served all three). The city of Philadelphia garnered five terms (19%): the University of Pennsylvania provided four (Shohat three, Kline one), while Drexel Institute’s Davis served one. In addition, Rutgers University’s Morris served two terms, while the New Jersey College for Women’s Nelson, also located at Rutgers, served one.</div>
