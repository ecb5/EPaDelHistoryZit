<div class="para">Not all activities that arose in the period 1956-1978 were related to high school mathematics. The entire 1958 meeting was devoted to the topic “Desirable mathematical training for the mathematician who plans to work in industry”. The impetus for the program came from the section’s chairman, I. Edward Block, then at Burroughs Corporation, who was unable to attend the 1958 meeting. Lafayette’s Charles Saalfrank presided in his place. The morning session consisted of three papers, two of which were delivered by speakers from Bell Telephone Laboratories and IBM. The afternoon session consisted of a panel discussion moderated by Mina Rees, then at Hunter College but known today primarily for her work administering grants for mathematicians from the Office of Naval Research. The panelists were Lehigh’s Everett Pitcher and the three speakers from the morning session.</div>
