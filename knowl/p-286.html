<div class="para">The lecture by the remaining émigré, Richard Courant, is noteworthy for several reasons. For one, it was the last lecture delivered during the period under discussion. For another, the subject matter was one dear to the speaker’s heart: applied mathematics. Another émigré, Lipman Bers, commenting on the value of many immigrants’ knowledge of applied mathematics, wrote, “Almost overnight, refugee mathematicians became a boon rather than a burden.” Like Bochner, Courant had been born in Poland but educated in Germany, obtaining his doctorate under David Hilbert at Göttingen in 1910. He was professor of mathematics and Director of the Mathematical Institute at Göttingen from 1920 until his dismissal by the Nazis in 1933. After spending the next academic year at Cambridge University, Courant crossed the ocean to become a professor of mathematics and head of the department at New York University. He held both posts until his retirement in 1958. Curiously, the fascinating biography of Courant by Constance Reid does not mention his lecture to our section.</div>
