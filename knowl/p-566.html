<div class="para">For over thirty years, Will has been an active participant in MAA activities. He has served the EPADEL section in every possible capacity: as a member of the Section Executive Committee 1967-69, as Section Chairman 1969-71, as Section Governor 1971-74, and as Section Secretary-Treasurer 1976-82. An enthusiastic and popular lecturer, he has given invited addresses at two section meetings. Mindful that Delaware is not a suburb of Philadelphia, he was instrumental in having the section name (formerly “Philadelphia Section”) changed to its present geographically descriptive form. Throughout his years as officer of the section, Will was the person to turn to when a difficult task had to be done, and was a primary source of guidance for section activities and policy matters.</div>
