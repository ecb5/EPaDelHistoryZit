<div class="para">Anna Johnson was born on May 5, 1883, in Hawarden, Iowa, where she attended public school. Although the youngest of three children, she was the first to attend college, entering the University of South Dakota at age 16 as a sub- freshman. She graduated four years later with an A.B. degree in mathematics. The professor of mathematics at South Dakota, Alexander Pell, became her mentor. Anna then won a scholarship to the University of Iowa, where she earned a masters degree in one year. Next she attended Radcliffe College, also on scholarship. She was awarded a second masters degree the following year, 1905. She remained at Radcliffe one more year before moving to Göttingen University, where she attended lectures by Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. The Palmer Fellowship that supported her study tour stipulated that all women remain unmarried throughout its duration. Hence she waited until July 1907, to marry her former mathematics professor – over the opposition of her parents, who objected to the 25-year age differential. Pell traveled to Göttingen for the wedding.</div>
