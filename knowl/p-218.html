<div class="para">Four of the talks given to the Philadelphia Section during 1928-1932 were concerned with geometry, one per year except 1929. The first was delivered in Penn’s Bennett Hall by section founder A. A. Bennett, who proposed that triangles be studied using the theory of binary forms instead of the usual approaches to geometry using synthetic methods, analytic geometry, projective methods, or inversive geometry. The second invited lecture was given by Ursinus College’s John W. Clawson, who described a polar reciprocation of a complete quadrilateral and some of its related points and lines with respect to a circle having the focal point (Steiner, Miquel) of the quadrilateral for center. The following year William M. Smith of Lafayette College outlined the facilities available for graduate study in Rome, where he had spent a sabbatical year studying under Enrico Bompiani. Smith also reviewed contributions made by Italian geometers to projective geometry and Riemannian geometry.</div>
