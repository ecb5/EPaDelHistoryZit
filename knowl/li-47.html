<dfn class="terminology">Emory P. Starke</dfn> 1896-1989) was born in New York City. He received all three of his degrees from Columbia University: A.B. 1916, M.A. 1917, and Ph.D. 1928. He joined the faculty at Rutgers in 1919 at age 23 and stayed there until compulsory retirement as professor emeritus in 1961. Instead of retiring completely, however, Starke spent the next five years as a professor at Bloomfield College. An inveterate problem solver, he is known to many present EPADEL members for his longtime stint of Associate Editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> and for his many contributions to its problems department. He took over the advanced problems section of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> in 1947 when that departmentâ€™s first editor, Otto Dunkel, asked to be relieved. Starke died in 1989 at age 93.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-47" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
