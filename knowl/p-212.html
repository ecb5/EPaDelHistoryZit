<div class="para">Only two invited speakers lectured on topics in algebra. One was the 1929 talk on group characters by Howard Mitchell, his second talk to the section he helped found three years earlier. Mitchell concluded his presentation by using group representations to prove a result of William Burnside that no group whose order is divisible by just two different primes can be simple. The only other lecture on algebra during this five-year period was the opening presentation at the 1931 meeting by Penn State’s C. A. Rupp, who used notions from linear algebra to “draw some geometric consequences of the linear dependence of flat spaces in a space of n dimensions.”</div>
