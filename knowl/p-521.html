<div class="para">Two talks at the 1957 meeting by Albert W. Tucker (Princeton) and David Rosen (Swarthmore) discussed aspects of high school mathematics. Tucker reported on a list of recommendations made by the Commission of Mathematics of the College Entrance Examination Board, while Rosen described a course he had designed for, and taught to, teachers taking part in an NSF summer institute. Two years later the concern for the preparation of high school teachers arose again when Vincent Haag of Franklin &amp; Marshall reported on the recent progress of SMSG and M. A. Linton, a teacher at the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia, discussed “Liaison problems in collegiate mathematics today – With the high school”. JoAnne Growney (Bloomsburg) wrote a two-page editorial in the section’s fall 1978 newsletter addressing the issues that Linton raised 20 years earlier. The unusually long title of the editorial provides a good synopsis of its content: “QUESTION: How can colleges and universities enroll students with better mathematical preparation? ANSWER: Work with elementary and secondary schools to improve programs there.”</div>
