<em class="alert">John Anthony Miller</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1859-1946\)</span>) was born in Indiana. After graduating from high school there, he taught in the public schools for several years before taking his bachelors degree at Indiana University in <span class="process-math">\(1890\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(30\text{.}\)</span>  One year later he accepted an instructorship at Stanford, which was just opening that year. A famous student in his first class was Herbert Hoover.  Miller took graduate courses at Stanford, resulting in a masters degree in <span class="process-math">\(1893\text{.}\)</span> The following year he returned to Indiana University as professor of mathematics. He seems to have become interested in applications because, after only one year, he switched from mathematics to the department of mechanics and astronomy, where he remained until <span class="process-math">\(1906\text{.}\)</span> In the meantime he enrolled at the University of Chicago. In <span class="process-math">\(1899\text{,}\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(39\text{,}\)</span> he earned his Ph.D. as Heinrich Maschke’s first doctoral student. Seven years later Miller accepted the positions of professor of astronomy and Director of the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore College; he held both for the next <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> years.  When he was elected our section’s fourth chairman in <span class="process-math">\(1929\text{,}\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(70\text{,}\)</span> he not only held two academic positions, he also served as Vice President at Swarthmore (since <span class="process-math">\(1914\)</span>). In that same year Indiana University bestowed an honorary doctorate upon him. Miller’s retirement in <span class="process-math">\(1932\)</span> did not equate to lack of work, as evidenced by the <span class="process-math">\(1935\)</span> publication of the second edition of his book <span class="booktitle">Analytic Mechanics</span>, which appeared initially in <span class="process-math">\(1915\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(1937\)</span> an appreciative group of Swarthmore alumni initiated the Miller Student Loan Fund in his honor.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-27" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
