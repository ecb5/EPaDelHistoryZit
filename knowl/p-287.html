<div class="para">The title of Courant’s lecture was “Problems of stability and instability demonstrated by soap film experiments”. In it he stated that if a dynamical system permits different states of stable equilibrium, corresponding to relative minima of the potential energy, there must exist transitions between these two states leading over an intermediary state of unstable equilibrium. Courant then demonstrated the principle with soap film experiments of a novel type, relating to minimal surfaces and systems of such surfaces. After that Courant discussed how these experiments pointed to a new field within the calculus of variations. He ended his talk by linking the newly formulated problems to classical isoperimetric problems.</div>
