<div class="para">Earlier we noted the waning influence of the University of Pennsylvania on sectional leadership. This can be seen in the sketches of the 15 different chairs in the period, none of whom was on the faculty at Penn. However, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table16.html" title="Table 6.3.2: ">Table 6.3.2</a>, which lists the doctorate granting university for the 13 chairs who received a Ph.D., reflects Penn’s continuing influence in a different light. It shows that 5 of the 13 (or 38%) received their Ph.D. from Penn. Indeed 10 (77%) received their highest degrees from Ivy League institutions.
