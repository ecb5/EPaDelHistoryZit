<div class="para">The program in 1943 featured the section’s first talk on foundations when J. B. Rosser spoke “On the many-valued logics”. This was the first time the section heard a talk on foundations, which is rather surprising in light of the fact that Alonzo Church and Kurt Gödel had propelled Princeton into worldwide leadership in the field since the 1930s. However, neither of these stalwarts ever attended a sectional meeting. Theodore Hailperin in 1948 and C. D. Firestone in 1950 gave other talks on foundations during this period.</div>
