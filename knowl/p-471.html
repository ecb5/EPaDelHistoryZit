<div class="para">Undergraduates appeared on the program at annual meetings for the first time in 1962, when one Swarthmore and two Penn students spoke. They were followed by James Bartoo, then the chairman of the department at Penn State, whose title was “Undergraduate mathematics: Problems posed by large enrollments”. A special session for students featured six 20-minute talks by undergraduates at the meeting held in 1974. Similarly, there were three student speakers in 1975 and four in 1977.</div>
