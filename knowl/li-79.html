He received a B.S. from Antioch College in 1958 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1965 for a dissertation on Lie rings written under the famous algebraist Nathan Jacobson. Gene Klotz came to Swarthmore College in 1963 and has remained there ever since. In 1971 he published the book Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry with former section chair Heinrich W. Brinkmann. Klotz was an associate professor when elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1975 and 1976, but was promoted to full professor the following year. He was an NSF Science Faculty Fellow in 1974 and the principal investigator for a 1981- 1982 NSF grant on mathematical education using information technology. His interests shifted to computers and mathematics during the 1980s, and he was one of the founders of the Math Forum on the Internet that has garnered international acclaim.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-79" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
