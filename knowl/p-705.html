<div class="para">After a year of teaching mathematics and science at Middleburg High School, Brubaker enrolled in the graduate program at Bowling Green University. He taught physics labs and problem sessions while completing requirements for his M.A. in mathematics in 1964. This was followed by a three-year appointment as instructor in mathematics at his alma mater, Susquehanna, 1964-1967. He then accepted an assistant professorship at Moravian College. This move to the Lehigh Valley made it particularly convenient to begin work toward his doctorate at Lehigh University. In spite of teaching full-time all the while, Brubaker earned his Ph.D. in October 1973 for a dissertation titled, “A comparison of the Shukla cohomology with a cotriple cohomology”, and written under Franklin Brenneman.</div>
