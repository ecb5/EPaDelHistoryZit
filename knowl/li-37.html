<em class="alert">Richard Morris</em> (1868-1951), who was born in Keyport, New Jersey, graduated from Peddie Institute in 1890. Even though it would be another six years before he would enroll at Rutgers, he entered as a sophomore because in the meantime he had acquired state certificates through study and teaching experience. He graduated from Rutgers with a B.S. in 1899 at age 30. That fall he served as superintendent of nearby schools, but at the same time he accepted an instructorship in the Department of Mathematics and Graphics and initiated graduate studies at his alma mater. He earned an M.S. in 1902. While Morris continued to be listed on the faculty at Rutgers, he pursued graduate studies at Cornell University, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1907. Upon graduation, Morris returned to Rutgers for the rest of his life, ending up teaching 45 years there. In 1918 he volunteered to teach at the new branch of the university, the New Jersey College for Women. Later he headed the department there; he also served as head of the mathematics department of the menâ€™s colleges from 1913 to 1944. Morris was 66 years old when elected chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1934. He retired as emeritus professor ten years later at age 76. Even at that point he devoted his time to tutoring Rutgers students, serving as a substitute teacher in the public schools, and filling vacancies in various pulpits of Methodist churches in the area. Morris died in New Brunswick at the age of 83.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-21.html#li-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
