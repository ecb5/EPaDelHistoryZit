<div class="para">The succession of Reynoldsâ€™ other contributions to the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> traces his development as a mathematician. In the banner year 1917 he published a small note in the Discussions Department. However, it would be another six years before his first refereed paper would appear. Altogether Reynolds published eight refereed articles in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, his last three appearing in Classroom Notes. Not all of his papers appeared in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>; two were published in the Tohuku Mathematical Journal and one in Agricultural Engineering.</div>
