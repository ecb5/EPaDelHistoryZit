<em class="alert">Frederick William Owens</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1880-1961\)</span>) was born in Iowa and received his B.S. degree from the University of Kansas in <span class="process-math">\(1902\text{.}\)</span> He continued graduate studies at Kansas, where he met and married fellow graduate student Helen Barten Brewster (<span class="process-math">\(1881-1968\)</span>). Both Frederick and Helen Owens then enrolled in the graduate program at the University of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. degree in <span class="process-math">\(1907\)</span> under the estimable E. H. Moore. Then he accepted an instructorship at Cornell University, where Helen B. Owens continued her graduate studies, obtaining a Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1910\)</span> under the department chairman, Virgil Snyder. In <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> the couple moved to Penn State, where Frederick became head of the department, a position he held until his retirement in <span class="process-math">\(1949\text{.}\)</span> Although he was unable to attend the organizational meeting of the section in <span class="process-math">\(1926\text{,}\)</span> held just a few months after he moved to State College, he did travel to Philadelphia for the second meeting and was rewarded with election as the section’s second chairman. Not only did Helen Owens accompany him to that meeting, but there is no record of the either one of them ever attending a meeting without the other. Helen herself had two careers, one as a suffragette (fighting for women’s rights in both New York and Kansas), and, later, as a mathematician (she was an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> and taught at Penn State <span class="process-math">\(1941-1949\)</span>).
