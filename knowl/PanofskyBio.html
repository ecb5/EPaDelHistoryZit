</div></aside> was raised outside of Philadelphia, PA (specifically in the towns of Bensalem and Holland). She had to switch schools in her very early years and because of inconsistencies in the schedules of the schools she learned to add and subtract before she learned to read.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen earned her B.S.Ed. from Millersville University in 2002, her M.S. from Lehigh University in 2004, and her Ph.D. also from Lehigh in 2008. From 2008 to 2012 she was an Assistant Professor at Cabrini College. In 2012 she accepted an Assistant Professor of Instruction position at Temple University. She was promoted to Associate Professor of Instruction in 2018.</div>
