<div class="para">At Penn Kline served as chairman of the department from 1928 until the year before his death in 1955. He also held the University’s prestigious Thomas A. Scott Professorship from 1940. Kline took several leaves of absence during his tenure. The first was during the year 1925-1926 as a Guggenheim Fellow at Göttingen University, which had arguably the very best mathematics department in the world at the time. Later he was a visiting professor at four different institutions: Bryn Mawr College (1935-1936), Swarthmore College (1938-1939), the University of Colorado (summer of 1949), and the University of Tübingen (first semester of the 1952-1953 academic year). His trip to Göttingen occurred while J. B. Reynolds was advancing the idea of forming an <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-149-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.7.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> section, which explains why Kline was not one of the founding members of the Philadelphia Section. However, he played an active role thereafter, being elected secretary- treasurer for 1927-1928 and chairman for 1932-1933. In addition, he attended numerous annual meetings.</div>
