<div class="para">At the 1938 meeting, the first hosted by Ursinus, Albert W. Tucker described the two one-semester geometry courses he offered at Princeton. One of them, called an “Introduction to Modern Geometry,” was designed for sophomores and dealt with geometries characterized by their groups of transformations. The other, “Elementary Topology,” was a course constructed for juniors. It dealt with topological properties in two and three dimensions, including the classification of 2-dimensional manifolds and examples of 3-dimensional manifolds, culminating in properties of general topological spaces. By examining manifolds in <span class="process-math">\(\cal R^3\text{,}\)</span> Tucker anticipated a topic that would earn Fields Medals for four mathematicians in the second half of the <span class="process-math">\(20^{th}\)</span> century: John Milnor in 1962, Steven Smale in 1966, William Thurston in 1982, and Michael Freedman in 1986.</div>
