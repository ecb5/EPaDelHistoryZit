<div class="para">Hans Rademacher, the third émigré to speak to the Philadelphia Section, also left his native Germany to avoid Nazi persecution, but not for religious reasons. Rademacher was a Protestant who became a Quaker when he came to Philadelphia. He was dismissed from his position as full professor at the University of Breslau in 1933 because he belonged to the International League for the Rights of Man and was president of the Breslau chapter of the German Society for Peace.</div>
