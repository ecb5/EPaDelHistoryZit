<div class="para">Altogether there were 12 panel discussions involving 39 panelists in the 23- year period. Five panelists appeared twice: Barnard Bissinger (1960, 1970), Albert Filano (1960, 1965), David Rosen (1964, 1966), Benjamin Volker (1969, 1975), and Donald Western (1966, 1972). Because the topics of many panels dealt with pre-college mathematics, it is not surprising that among the 39 panelists, eight came from two-year institutions and six from high schools. Four of the remaining 25 panelists came from outside the area: Brown, Colgate, Columbia, and Hunter. From our section, four of the 21 panelists were affiliated with Franklin &amp; Marshall, while five institutions were home to two panelists: Delaware, Drexel, Lehigh, Swarthmore, and West Chester.</div>
