<div class="para">This governance system worked without interruption for 12 years. However, the unexpected death of section chair Emil Amelotti on March 3, 1968, midway through his second one-year term, showed the need for additional change. Amelotti’s illness had prevented him from presiding over the meeting the previous fall; secretary-treasurer Voris Latshaw presided in his place. S. S. McNeary agreed to fill Amelotti’s remaining term, including presiding at the annual meeting held in November 1968. At the business part of the meeting one amendment to the by-laws provided for a new position of vice-chairman of the section. The vice-chairman would assume the chairmanship should that position become vacant (it has not since then); the vice-chairman’s main duty was to plan the program for the next annual meeting. Another amendment to the by-laws increased the number of Executive Committee members from three to six. Both of these changes are still operative today. The section’s by-laws were amended again in 1971 to bring them “into conformity with the model By-Laws” suggested by the MAA’s Committee on Sections.</div>
