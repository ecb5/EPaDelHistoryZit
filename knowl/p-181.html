<em class="alert">Edwin Schofield Crawley</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1862-1933\)</span>) attended five of the first seven meetings. Crawley is a native Philadelphian who received his bachelors degree from the University of Pennsylvania in <span class="process-math">\(1882\text{.}\)</span> He then became an instructor in the Department of Civil Engineering at Penn. In <span class="process-math">\(1885\)</span> he switched to the Department of Mathematics. Crawley was married in <span class="process-math">\(1888\)</span> and resided in the city of Philadelphia his entire life. In <span class="process-math">\(1892\)</span> he was awarded the first Ph.D. in mathematics that Penn ever granted. No dissertation supervisor is recorded for his thesis; it was common practice at the time to fashion a dissertation as a collection of published articles so there was no need to acknowledge any special guidance provided by a senior member of the department. In 1899 he was appointed to the Thomas A.  Scott professorship of mathematics. Today the Department of Mathematics at Penn dates its modern period from the appointment of E. S. Crawley as head of the department. To commemorate this date the department sponsored a celebration on October <span class="process-math">\(30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1999\text{,}\)</span> called “A Century of Math at Penn”.</div></li>

<em class="alert">George Abram Harter</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1853-1943\)</span>) was born in Maryland. He became an assistant professor of mathematics and Latin at St. John’s College (Maryland) after earning his bachelors degree there in <span class="process-math">\(1878\text{.}\)</span> He remained in this position until receiving his masters degree two years later. From then until <span class="process-math">\(1885\)</span> he was a principal at two different schools. In the meantime he was awarded a Ph.D. from St. John’s College in <span class="process-math">\(1882\text{.}\)</span> Harter joined the faculty of Delaware College (now the University of Delaware) in <span class="process-math">\(1885\text{.}\)</span>  Initially he was a professor of mathematics and modern languages, but, after three years, physics replaced languages. In <span class="process-math">\(1896\)</span> he was chosen as President of the University of Delaware, a position he held until <span class="process-math">\(1914\text{.}\)</span> Subsequent chapters will record several other instances of Delaware mathematicians rising to top positions in the university administration.</div></li>

<em class="alert">Albert Eugene Meder, Jr.,</em> was born in <span class="process-math">\(1903\)</span> in New York City, where he attended Columbia University, receiving an A.B. in <span class="process-math">\(1922\)</span> and an A.M. in <span class="process-math">\(1923\text{.}\)</span> He spent <span class="process-math">\(1922-1926\)</span> on Columbia’s faculty before moving to Rutgers University, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty in <span class="process-math">\(1945\text{,}\)</span> which explains why he was referred to as Dean A. E. Meder in subsequent literature. Earlier in his tenure at Rutgers, Meder held two administrative positions at the New Jersey College for Women, Acting Dean <span class="process-math">\(1932-1934\)</span> and Admissions Officer <span class="process-math">\(1933-1934\text{.}\)</span> This helps to explain why the New Jersey College for Women at Rutgers hosted the annual meeting of the Philadelphia Section in <span class="process-math">\(1933\text{.}\)</span> Meder helped found the New Jersey Section in <span class="process-math">\(1956\text{.}\)</span> He was elected that section’s first chairman during the year <span class="process-math">\(1956-1957\text{;}\)</span> he held the position again <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> years later. The report of a panel he chaired at the section’s second meeting, “The education of mathematics teachers”, was published in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> in <span class="process-math">\(1959\text{.}\)</span> Meder also served on several <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-138-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> committees. According to a reviewer, his 1967 pamphlet Topics from Inversive Geometry “was apparently designed for high school students ... [but] would be enlightening to many college students.” Today Dean Meder is retired and living in Manchester, Vermont.</div></li>
