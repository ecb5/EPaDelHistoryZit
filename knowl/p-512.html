<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">David Rosen</dfn> (1921-2003) was born in New Haven, Connecticut,. He received an A.B. from New York University in 1942 and then two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1952 (for a dissertation written under Joseph Lehner). Rosen was an assistant instructor at Penn during his last three years of graduate study. In 1955 he accepted a position at Swarthmore College, replacing Arnold Dresden, the former section chair who had just retired. Rosen remained at Swarthmore until his retirement in 1987. He was an NSF faculty fellow in 1961-1962 and a Fulbright Professor in Ireland in 1971-1972. Rosen served the section in two official capacities, as a member of the Executive Committee 1960- 1963 and as governor 1974-1977. His volunteer activity in sectional affairs was inspired by Arnold Dresden; Rosen in turn was responsible for the involvement of Jerry Porter. Rosen resides in Swarthmore. Although he continues to play the bass in the college orchestra, he is no longer able to play his favorite sport, tennis.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Jerry Porter King</dfn> was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee, in 1935. He took all his degrees from the University of Kentucky, a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1958 followed by two degrees in mathematics, an M.S. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1962. In <a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a> we noted that King’s thesis advisor, V. F. Cowling, taught at Lehigh University from 1949 to 1961 before moving to the University of Kentucky. Jerry King was one of Cowling’s first doctoral students at Kentucky, and Cowling must have retained sufficiently cordial relations with the Lehigh administration, because he recommended his student to the Bethlehem school. The fit was perfect, and King has been at Lehigh since accepting that first position in 1962. Between 1966 and 1984 he produced nine Ph.D. students, two of whom have been active in sectional activities – Frederick (“Fritz”) Hartmann (1968) and Deborah Frantz (1984). King also served in two high-ranking administrative capacities, associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences 1979-1981 and dean of the graduate school 1981-1987. In addition, he has served the section in numerous ways: as director of the program of visiting lectures (1974), member of the Executive Committee 1973-1776, director of the program for student speakers (1977), and governor 1977-1980. Besides that, King presented two invited lectures, in 1981 and 1997; he also delivered invited addresses at three other MAA sections: Kentucky in 1981, Allegheny in 1995, and New Jersey in 1997. He resides in Bethlehem.</div></li>
