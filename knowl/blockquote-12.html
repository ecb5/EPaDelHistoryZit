<div class="para"><dfn class="terminology">CERTIFICATE OF MERITORIUS SERVICE</dfn></div> <div class="para">The Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section of the Mathematical Association of America is pleased to nominate Professor Willard E. Baxter as the section’s first recipient of the MAA certificate of meritorious service. The section gratefully recognizes the many contributions Will has made not only to the MAA but to the wider mathematical community of researchers, teachers and students, both in high school and universities.</div> <div class="para">A student of I. N. Herstein, Will Baxter received his Ph.D. from the university of Pennsylvania in 1956. Known as a fine research algebraist, he has been on the mathematics faculty at the University of Delaware for 28 years, and served as department chairman 1970-75.</div> <div class="para">For over thirty years, Will has been an active participant in MAA activities. He has served the EPADEL section in every possible capacity: as a member of the Section Executive Committee 1967-69, as Section Chairman 1969-71, as Section Governor 1971-74, and as Section Secretary-Treasurer 1976-82. An enthusiastic and popular lecturer, he has given invited addresses at two section meetings. Mindful that Delaware is not a suburb of Philadelphia, he was instrumental in having the section name (formerly “Philadelphia Section”) changed to its present geographically descriptive form. Throughout his years as officer of the section, Will was the person to turn to when a difficult task had to be done, and was a primary source of guidance for section activities and policy matters.</div> <div class="para">Will’s enthusiasm for and encouragement of young mathematical talent is evidenced by his long and continuing involvement as regional coordinator of the annual American High School Mathematics Examination and as director of the Delaware Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. He has also had a fruitful association with in-service training of teachers of mathematics, and is currently involved in materials development for high schools. His concern for the teaching of service calculus courses, coupled with his interest in mathematical modeling produced a pioneering book, co-authored with Clifford W. Sloyer which combined probability with calculus and was intended for students in the biological and managerial sciences.</div> <div class="para">All of these activities have contributed to the life and health of the mathematical community. For his many years of dedication and service, we are pleased to honor Will Baxter with this award.</div>
