He was Drexel’s representative to SIAM, and he served for several years as an editor of the SIAM Newsletter and the SIAM Review. He was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1960. He also agreed to assume the chairmanship in 1968 when Emil Amelotti passed away midway through his second one-year term.
