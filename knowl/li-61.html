<dfn class="terminology">Foster Leroy Dennis</dfn> (1910-1983) was born on New Yearâ€™s Day in West Milton, PA. He received a B.S. degree from Ursinus College in 1931, an M.S. from Cornell the next year, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1938 (under Arnold Emch). Before enrolling at Illinois he taught at his alma mater, Ursinus, for one year, and he returned to the same department upon obtaining his doctorate. Although F. L. Dennis remained at Ursinus for the rest of his life, he also taught courses at a Penn State extension for two years during World War II, worked for the State Department of Public Instruction for a year, and was a consultant for Philco Corporation. He was a member of the Program Committee of the Philadelphia Section in 1944 and 1953.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-61" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
