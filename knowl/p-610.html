<div class="para">Now we provide information on the remaining 12 institutions that hosted one meeting during the EPADEL period. The 1982 meeting at West Chester University and the 1987 meeting at Franklin &amp; Marshall College were the third hosted by each institution; West Chester hosted earlier meetings in 1965 and 1970, while F&amp;M hosted meetings in 1962 and 1975. Five schools hosted their second meeting: Villanova University in 1981 (the first was in 1966), Bryn Mawr College in 1983 (1947), Millersville University in 1989 (1978), Muhlenberg College in 1992 (1956), and Montgomery County Community College in 1994 (1976). The four remaining meetings were held at institutions hosting a fall meeting for the only time in the section’s history: Temple University in 1985, Cedar Crest College in 1993, Delaware State University in 1996, and, to celebrate the school’s 100 th anniversary, Elizabethtown College in 1999. The meeting at Delaware State marked the only time the section met at one of its three historically black institutions; none has been held at Lincoln University or Cheyney University so far.</div>
