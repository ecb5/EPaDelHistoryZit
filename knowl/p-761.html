<div class="para">The first EPADEL meeting of the third millennium (or the last meeting of the second millennium, depending on your viewpoint) was devoted to statistics. Hence it was not by chance that two of the four speakers were graduates of the host institution, Messiah College. Mark Heise B.A. 1986) spoke on “Statistics and the drug development process”. As senior statistician at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, and formerly a statistician at Procter &amp; Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Heise was particularly suited to discuss this topic. Tonya Sharpe King (B.A. 1992) spoke on “The role of the statistician in the academic research hospital setting”. Like Heise, her employment record certainly made her well suited for the task because, after obtaining her Ph.D. in biostatistics, she accepted an assistant professorship in biostatistics at Penn State’s College of Medicine at the Hershey Medical Center.</div>
