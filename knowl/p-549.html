<div class="para">Eight addresses in the category of algebra/number theory were delivered, and all six in algebra dealt with mainstream topics. We already mentioned Samuel Plotkin’s 1976 talk on applications of group theory to music and Stephen Shatz’s 1977 talk on algebraic curves. The four other talks on algebra were M. O. Rabin (1956), “Impossibility of computational algorithms for group-theoretic problems”; J. C. Moore (1966), “Some aspects of homological algebra – Background and recent developments”; James Brooks (1967), “Equivalence of matrices and modules over Dedekind domains”; and Charles Curtis (1968), “Characters of finite groups”. The two talks on number theory were Peter Scherk (1956), “Integers,” and Hans Rademacher (1961), “Gaussian polynomials and pentagonal numbers”. Rademacher’s talk was the last of four that he gave to the section.</div>
