<dfn class="terminology">Albert William Tucker</dfn> o(1905-1995) was born in Oshawa, Canada. He obtained a B.A. at the University of Toronto in 1928 and then two degrees at Princeton University: M.A. 1929 and Ph.D. 1932 (under the famous topologist, Solomon Lefschetz). Tucker joined the faculty at Princeton the next year and taught there until his retirement in 1974. Known for his seminal contributions to linear and non-linear programming and to game theory, he held Princeton’s prestigious Dod Professorship from 1954 until 1974. Tucker’s first Ph.D. student (in 1950) was John Nash, a Nobel Prize winner in economics. He also directed the 1972 dissertation of our own active member, Stephen Maurer. Two other Tucker mathematical products are his sons Thomas W. Tucker (Colgate) and Alan C. Tucker (SUNY - Stony Brook); the latter spoke to our section in 1982. A. W. Tucker died in Princeton at age 89.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-28.html#li-66" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
