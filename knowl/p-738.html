<div class="para">The next two meetings were conducted in a manner similar to the standard format at fall meetings. The theme of the 1983 meeting, “Mathematics and artificial intelligence”, was addressed in two lectures in the morning and two in the afternoon. Only three of the talks were announced, however – Aravind Joshi (Penn), “Grammatical representations in natural language processing: Some mathematical results,” Jack Minker (Maryland), “Logic and its uses in artificial intelligence and databases,” and Casimir Kulikowski (Rutgers), “Expert systems”.</div>
