<div class="para">Although the section sponsored six talks on traditional <dfn class="terminology">applications</dfn> of mathematics during the present period, the types of applications varied considerably. The two lectures by EPADEL members concentrated on economics. In 1994, J. Michael Steele, of the Wharton School at Penn, spoke on “Ruin and riches from Bachelier to Black-Scholes”. Four years later Lehigh’s Vladimir Dobric lectured on a similar theme in his presentation, “A fundamental model in mathematical finance”. The other four speakers described a range of applications whose content can be inferred from their titles – Ward Whitt (1980; AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories), “Approximation for networks of queues (description of complex systems adequate for engineering purposes)”, Daniel Gottlieb (1988; Purdue), “Topology and the robot arm”, John D. Grace (1990; Atlantic Richfield Corp.), “Oil and uncertainty”, and Joseph A. Gallian (1993; Minnesota), “The mathematics of identification numbers”.</div>
