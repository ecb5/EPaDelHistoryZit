<div class="para">The 1964 meeting began with an Edwin Moise lecture bearing the same title as a talk he gave eight years earlier. Princeton probabilist William Feller followed Moise. He spoke on exactly the same topic as his 1955 talk – differential operators – only this time he gave an intrinsic characterization of second order differential operators on the line. Once again there was no mention of probability in the talk.</div>
