<div class="para">While David Rosen was assuring the Philadelphia Section membership that no sudden increase in dues would be imminent, his colleague, section chair Gene Klotz, was playing a different tune locally. Klotz wrote, “Our By-Laws prohibit charging more than $1.00 registration fee at our fall meeting. We have recently taken to inviting speakers from outside the section to our fall meeting and special meetings ... It has been recommended that we raise the registration fee (one specific figure mentioned was to $3.00.)” The by-laws were subsequently changed and the registration fee rose to $2.50 at the fall 1977 meeting. For comparison’s sake, that fee had increased to $17 ($15 in advance) at the fall 2000 meeting at Penn State – Abington.</div>
