<div class="para">Bennett was certainly right on target about attendance from mathematicians located in Delaware and southern New Jersey. Delaware has remained an integral part of the section since its founding. However, a New Jersey Section was created in <span class="process-math">\(1956\text{,}\)</span> and although most residents from the southern part of the Garden State have participated in its activities since its inception, several continue to attend the Philadelphia Sectionâ€™s programs. As we shall see, mathematicians from Princeton and Rutgers were especially active in the Philadelphia Section in the <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>-year period from the founding of the section in <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> to the founding of the New Jersey Section.</div>
