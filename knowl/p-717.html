<div class="para">Bedient’s report to the MAA listed the attendance at 158. The section’s archives do not contain a meeting program so we are unable to provide details. However, the archives include Growney’s outline beforehand, from which we conclude that the program consisted of four one-hour sessions. The morning program included “Mathematics in the social sciences” (moderated by Eugene Klotz) and “Mathematics in biology and medicine” (moderated by Growney). The afternoon program was envisioned to consist of “Statistics, computer science, operations research, and other applied areas in the departmental curriculum” and “Careers for mathematics majors”.</div>
