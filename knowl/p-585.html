<div class="para">Schattschneider has also been an active participant in the national MAA. She was the first woman editor of Mathematics Magazine (1981-1985), served as a governor from 1981 to 1989, and was elected vice-president from 1994 to 1996. In addition, she was a councilor for Pi Mu Epsilon from 1990 to 1996. Her activity has garnered her several awards, including the 1979 Allendoerfer Award for her paper “Tiling the plane with congruent pentagons,” which appeared in Mathematics Magazine the previous year. She was also awarded a Certificate of Meritorious Service by the MAA in 1991. In the year 2000, Gerald Porter and she were awarded certificates of appreciation for their role “in the installation of a very special tiling in the front lobby area” of the MAA headquarters. Finally, she won the MAA’s initial Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics in 1993. Only two other members of our section have won this award, Herbert S. Wilf in 1996 and Rhonda Hughes in 1998.</div>
