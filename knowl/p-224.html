<div class="para">One of the founders of the Philadelphia Section, Howard Mitchell, spoke to the section on three separate occasions. We have already described his talks at the organizational meeting in 1926 and the 1929 meeting at his home institution, Penn. He also presented the very last talk in the five-year period under discussion, “The life and work of Ramanujan”. As Perry Caris wrote in his official report from the 1932 meeting at Swarthmore College, “The title ... sufficiently indicates the nature of the paper.” This was not the last time our section would be treated to a talk about the fascinating story of Ramanujan and his phenomenal discoveries in number theory, as Nathan Fine lectured on this same subject in 1952 based on material unavailable to Mitchell at the time. In 1990 George Andrews also spoke about Ramanujan’s mathematics at a student conference held at Moravian College. All three Ramanujan speakers – Mitchell, Fine, and Andrews – were associated with the University of Pennsylvania, the first two as faculty members and the last as a doctoral student. Both Fine and Andrews ended up at Penn State.</div>
