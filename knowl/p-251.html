<div class="para">This chapter describes activities in the Philadelphia Section from the first annual meeting held outside Pennsylvania, in 1933, to the one held two weeks before the United States entered World War II in 1941. The chapter introduces a new set of leaders and describes some of their professional activities. Perhaps the most active of them all – J. A. Shohat – is, like Hans Rademacher, accorded a personal profile at the end of the chapter as a tribute to his many contributions. The five new chairs of the section are associated with five different institutions – W. M. Smith (Lafayette), Richard Morris (Rutgers), J. W. Clawson (Ursinus), L. L. Smail (Lehigh), and C. O. Oakley (Haverford). There are also biographical sketches of two members of the Program Committee – C. B. Allendoerfer (Haverford) and H. W. Brinkmann (Swarthmore) – and one invited lecturer, A. G. Rau (Moravian). The chapter ends by analyzing the themes of the invited lectures, with a discussion of those addresses delivered by émigrés complementing an analysis by mathematical category.</div>
