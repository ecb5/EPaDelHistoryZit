He received two degrees in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley, an A.B. in 1933 and an M.A. the following year. He was the president of the Pi Mu Epsilon fraternity at Berkeley for two years, 1932-1934. During this time he delivered one talk each year to the honorary organization, the first titled “Number ratios” and the second “Dimensional analysis”. For the next two years Oxtoby enrolled in the graduate program at Harvard University, where he served as the secretary- treasurer of the Harvard Mathematical Club for 1935-1936.</div>
