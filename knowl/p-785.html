<div class="para">The undergraduate curricula have also been a concern of the section. In 1931, Professor Dresden spoke on the Swarthmore Honors Program. In 1951, Col R.C. Yates of West Point spoke on motivating freshmen, while in 1953, C.O. Oakley of Haverford addressed the topic of a new approach to freshman mathematics. In 1970 the program included a Panel Discussion on Computers in the first two years of College Mathematics. Participating were Gerald Porter of Penn and Carl Leinbach of Gettysburg. It is with special note that I call attention to the agenda of Morris Kline, of NYU who in 1956 took the view that the usual math taught freshmen (college algebra and analytic geometry) was meaningless, unmotivated, lacked in aesthetic quality and was incoherent.
