<dfn class="terminology">James Elmer Davis</dfn> (1887-1964) was born and raised in Wisconsin. He attended the Wisconsin State Normal School from 1901 to 1905 but for unknown reasons left without obtaining a degree. He then taught at public schools in Wisconsin and South Dakota until 1910, whereupon he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, earning two degrees, a bachelors in 1912 and a masters in 1913. That year Davis accepted a position at the Pennsylvania State College (now University), so his affiliation was listed as Penn State when he became a charter member of the national MAA in 1916. He served in the army during World War I from 1917 through 1919. In the early 1920s he taught at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Arkansas before accepting a position at the Drexel Institute of Technology in the fall of 1923. He remained in the EPADEL region for the rest of his professional career, almost all of it spent at Drexel, where he served as chair of the department from 1942 until his retirement in 1952. Davis was an active member of the MAA from the time he attended the annual MAA meeting at the University of Pennsylvania in 1926. He attended almost all of the section’s annual meetings and played a pivotal role in the section’s being able to hold annual meetings throughout World War II. Davis’s election to head the Philadelphia Section made him the first in a line of chairs from Drexel who held that office each decade from the 1940s through the 1980s. He died in Florida in 1964 after having been an MAA member for 48 years.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-48" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
