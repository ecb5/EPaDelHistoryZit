<div class="para">The program for the 1962 meeting included student speakers for the first time. At the time two students from Penn and one from Swarthmore were listed as part of the usual program. Apparently that program was not deemed successful because students were not part of any program for another 12 years. In 1974 there was a special session of 20-minute contributed papers at which six students from a number of schools spoke (two from Swarthmore and one each from Villanova, Delaware, Moravian, and even Princeton). The topics ranged from calculus to graph theory to computer programming. Special sessions were also held in 1975, when three papers were presented (by students from Muhlenberg, Swarthmore, and Lafayette) and in 1977, when four papers were presented (by students from Temple, Muhlenberg, Shippensburg, and Delaware). The success of the program of student speakers hid the difficulty of attracting students to present their work in such a public forum. The head of the program, Jerry King, hinted at the underlying problem in his report from the fall of 1977, when he wrote, “There’s been a problem in the past in getting volunteers for student talks, although those that have been given have been appreciated.”</div>
