<div class="para">Although nobody from the University of Pennsylvania was elected chair during this period, the city of Philadelphia was home to chairs from other academic institutions in the Quaker City for eight of the 23 years. This included officers from the Drexel Institute of Technology (McNeary and Pervin) in addition to first-time representation from LaSalle (Albright), Temple (Lawton), Villanova (Amelotti), and Burroughs (Block). Albright and Amelotti were their schools’ only chairs in the section’s 75-year history. Lehr (Bryn Mawr) and Klotz (Swarthmore) were the last representatives from their schools to be elected chair. Lehr’s election in 1958 followed Bryn Mawr’s Anna Pell Wheeler (1943) and John Oxtoby (1955), while Klotz’s elections in 1975 and 1976 made him the only other chair from Swarthmore except for Arnold Dresden (1940).</div>
