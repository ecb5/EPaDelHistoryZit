<div class="para">Although Kutztown’s indefatigable Deborah Frantz became the EPADEL coordinator one year later, she recalls that Albright was the first school to request information from Baxter. Nonetheless, the new coordinator was soon boasting that our section sponsored 10 of the 160 nationwide sections. (EPADEL is the 13 th largest of the 29 sections.) Moreover, Frantz manned a student-chapters table at our section’s spring 1990 meeting and arranged for a program of 10-minute talks to run in a parallel session in the afternoon. When asked how she became involved in student chapters, she replied, “In the spring of 1990 the national MAA Committee on Student Chapters was in its infancy and I got a call from then-chair Howard Anton asking if I’d be willing to write a newsletter for the newly-created Student Chapters. The idea was that I’d write a first issue and then serve as editor of the newsletter once things caught on. As newsletter ‘editor’, I served on the National MAA Committee on Student Chapters for about seven years. This entailed not only the compilation of newsletters twice each year, but also attending the National Joint Meetings and helping to develop the newly- created Student Chapters.”</div>
