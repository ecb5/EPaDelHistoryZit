<div class="para">The next notable event to take place at an annual meeting was a presentation in 1954 titled “Mathematics through the television lens”. Not exactly a panel discussion, it featured three speakers who discussed various ways to teach mathematics via this relatively new medium. Although panel discussions per se did not start in the section for four more years, this program might be considered the prototype of a format that has been used successfully on numerous occasions since then. The 1954 meeting included three outstanding lectures in addition to this presentation. To open the program Ernst Snapper talked on “Coordinates of algebraic varieties”. The two lectures after lunch were “Area and volume” by A. S. Besicovitch and “Some remarks on numerical stability” by Herman Goldstine. Besicovitch’s topic was not surprising; 28 years earlier he had shown that there exist planar regions of arbitrarily small area in which a segment of fixed length could be rotated, thus solving the Kakeya needle problem. Goldstine demonstrated the electronic computer that had been developed at the Institute for Advanced Study. Goldstine, a 1936 Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, was appointed a permanent member of the Institute in 1952 and served as the associate director of the electronic computer project there from 1946 to 1955. Although born in 1913, hence approaching his 90 th birthday, Goldstine remains active with the American Philosophical Society, located on Independence Mall in Philadelphia.</div>
