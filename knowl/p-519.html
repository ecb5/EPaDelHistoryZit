<div class="para">Institutional affiliations are as diverse as the speakers, with 18 institutions accounting for the 80 lecturers. Once again the University of Pennsylvania led the way with 14, followed by Lehigh University and Princeton University (7 each), Bell Labs and Swarthmore College (4 each), Bryn Mawr College and Penn State (3 each), and the University of Delaware, Drexel University, and New York University (2 each). It is notable that even though the sectionâ€™s boundaries no longer included New Jersey or central Pennsylvania, seven speakers came from Princeton and three from Penn State. It is also notable that whereas heretofore few speakers were invited from outside the area, there were so many after 1956 that we do not bother to single them out. Academic diversity amongst invited speakers is reflected in a different way, because three of them were high school teachers and nine held nonacademic affiliations at the time of their lecture. From the latter set, four came from Bell Labs and one each from the Bureau of Standards, General Motors, IBM, American Cyanamid, and the Department of Public Instruction. The last affiliation is reminiscent of the program at the organizational meeting in 1926 when the final speaker was J. A. Foberg, the State Director of Science and Mathematics for Pennsylvania.</div>
