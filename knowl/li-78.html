</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Joerg Werner Peter Mayer</dfn> was born in 1929 in Germany. He received his advanced degrees at Universität Gießen, with a 1954 doctorate based on a dissertation written under A. Peyerimhoff. He taught at the University of Malaysia 1954-1957. Mayer then came to the University of New Mexico, where he directed six Ph.D. students. He left New Mexico in 1968 to become chair of the department at George Mason University in Virginia. However, two years later Mayer found an area much more to his liking and moved to Lebanon Valley College, where he remained until his retirement in 1997. He served as chair of the department 1970-1982 and as director of the new computer center 1973-1975. Mayer discussed his chairing of our section and the MD-VA-DC section in a 1982 MAA invited lecture titled, “Reflections of a maverick chairman”. He is the author of two books, Algebraic Topology (1972) and Assembly Language Programming (1991). Although he has a daughter and four sons, he is not related to Jörg-Peter Mayer, who received a doctorate from Universität Kiel in 1997. Our Mayer has lived in Brattleboro, VT, since his retirement.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-78" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
