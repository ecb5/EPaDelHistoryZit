<div class="para">Doris Schattschneider has written numerous works that have been popular and positively reviewed. In 1979, she wrote the book (with L. F. Baker), <span class="booktitle">The Perceptive Eye: Art and Mathematics</span>, which was based on a special exhibit held at the Allentown Art Museum in the spring of that year. Schattschneider was a curator of this exhibit! An especially successful book titled M. C. Escher Kaleidocycles, written with Wallace Walker, appeared in different versions in 1977, 1982, and 1987. From 1986 to 1991 she was the senior associate and “geometer” of the Visual Geometry Project, directed by Gene Klotz and funded by the NSF. This project produced videos and activity books on polyhedra and symmetry; it now offers the popular software program called The Geometer’s Sketchpad.</div>
