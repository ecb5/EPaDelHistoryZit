<div class="para">The 1976 meeting at Montgomery County Community College included two talks by section members whose affiliations reflect the academic (two-year institution) and geographic (northeast Pennsylvania) broadening of the section. The host school’s Samuel Plotkin spoke about applications of group theory, though that topic might not be evident from his theatrical title, “The sound of music”.
