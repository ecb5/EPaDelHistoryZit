<div class="para">Other, who I remember, are W. Kuhn of Bryn Mawr, Curtis Greene of Haverford, J. Koch of Wilkes College who talked on his contribution to the solution of The Four Color Problem, R.D. Luce, a psychologist then at Penn, and known for his modeling “choice behavior”, and the most talented lecturer, Herb Wilf. Each of these individuals shared their talents with the section. I certainly have missed many individuals. I do so, with a general salute of thanks.</div>
