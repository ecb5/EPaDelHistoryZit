<em class="alert">Lloyd Leroy Smail</em> (1888-1955) was born in Kansas. He received two degrees from the University of Washington at Seattle, an A.B. in 1911 and an A.M. in 1912. The following year he received a Ph.D. from Columbia University. He then returned to the West Coast as an instructor at his alma mater. Smail left Washington for the University of Oregon two years later. He remained at Oregon for two years before heading to the University of Texas, but he left there after only one year to accept a position at Lehigh University. After relatively short durations at three land-grant universities, Smail stayed at Lehigh from 1926 until his retirement as emeritus professor in 1953. He was active in the Philadelphia Section since becoming one of its charter members in the fall of his arrival on the Bethlehem campus. In fact, he presented an invited lecture at the organizational meeting in November 1926. One month later he spoke at the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-165-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>/<a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-166-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> meeting at the University of Pennsylvania, with both lectures centering on Dedekind’s theory of irrational numbers. Smail spoke again at the 1931 annual meeting of the Philadelphia Section. His last official participation with the section was his election to the Program Committee in 1947. When he died at age 66 he had been a member of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-167-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.2.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> for 31 years.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-21.html#li-39" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
