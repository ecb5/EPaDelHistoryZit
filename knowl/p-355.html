<dfn class="terminology">Carl John Rees</dfn> (1896-1986) was born in Millersville, PA. He received his A.B. degree from Franklin &amp; Marshall in 1918 and joined the faculty at the University of Delaware two years later. While continuing to teach at Delaware he obtained a masters degree from the University of Chicago in 1925, probably taking classes at Chicagoâ€™s famed summer session. He received his Ph.D. under section chair J. A. Shohat at Penn in 1940. At that time, Rees was appointed chairman of the department at Delaware, a position he held for the next ten years. He became the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies at Delaware in 1950, holding the post until 1962. In the meantime he also served as Provost of the University from 1955 to 1962. Rees retired as professor emeritus in 1962. He died in Newark, Delaware, in 1986, just three months shy of his 90 th birthday.</div></li></ul></div>
