<div class="para">Jerry Porter has been a vital cog in EPADEL’s leadership for the past 30 years, beginning as a panel participant at the section’s 1970 meeting. He was elected to a three-year term on the Executive Committee five years later. In 1979 he was the program chair for the spring meeting held at Penn, and the following year he was elected to a three-year term as governor. In 1980 he also presented a perspicacious address on “The future of the MAA”. Two years later he gave a 30-minute presentation on “Linear algebra in computer graphics” at the spring meeting and moderated a panel discussion on CUPM recommendations at the fall meeting. He has served on numerous nomination and program committees and is currently the EPADEL Webmaster.</div>
