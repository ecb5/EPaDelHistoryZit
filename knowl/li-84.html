</h3> <dfn class="terminology">David Rosen</dfn> (1921-2003) was born in New Haven, Connecticut,. He received an A.B. from New York University in 1942 and then two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1952 (for a dissertation written under Joseph Lehner). Rosen was an assistant instructor at Penn during his last three years of graduate study. In 1955 he accepted a position at Swarthmore College, replacing Arnold Dresden, the former section chair who had just retired. Rosen remained at Swarthmore until his retirement in 1987. He was an NSF faculty fellow in 1961-1962 and a Fulbright Professor in Ireland in 1971-1972. Rosen served the section in two official capacities, as a member of the Executive Committee 1960- 1963 and as governor 1974-1977. His volunteer activity in sectional affairs was inspired by Arnold Dresden; Rosen in turn was responsible for the involvement of Jerry Porter. Rosen resides in Swarthmore. Although he continues to play the bass in the college orchestra, he is no longer able to play his favorite sport, tennis.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-36.html#li-84" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
