<div class="para">The account of sectional activities is followed by a brief look at leaders who shaped those activities over the past 22 years. We provide brief sketches of all presidents, secretary-treasurers, and governors, as well as a few other selected individuals who contributed in vital ways. One president, Marvin Brubaker, is profiled at the end of the chapter to honor his many contributions to the section and the national MAA. We also analyze the academic affiliations of the elected officers. Although we examine membership on the Executive Committee, we provide sketches of only two members who were not elected to other positions of leadership.</div>
