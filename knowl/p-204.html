<div class="para">The Program Committee for the 1930 meeting (Tomlinson Fort, J. R, Kline, and John Miller) selected three speakers who presented talks on classical analysis at the meeting held at Penn. The host institution’s James A. Shohat, whose contributions to the Philadelphia Section will be detailed in the next chapter, opened the meeting with a lecture on Tchebycheff polynomials. After reminding the audience of the definition of these polynomials, he proved existence and uniqueness theorems for orthogonal polynomials, and then he proved results about their minimum properties and about the distribution of their roots. Penn State’s I. M. Sheffer spoke about non-analytic functions of a complex variable, referring on several occasions to the work of Edward Kasner. Sheffer ended the talk by introducing matrices associated with the differentiation of non-analytic functions. The day’s final speaker was Lehigh’s Tomlinson Fort, who had also delivered an invited address at the section’s second meeting in 1927. In summarizing Fort’s talk, the section’s secretary, Perry Caris, wrote briefly that Fort “discussed the fundamental notions of the papers by Harald Bohr.” That was no mean feat, as the famous Danish mathematician published his results in three long papers that ran to almost 300 pages in the esteemed journal <span class="booktitle">Acta Mathematica</span> in 1925 and 1926.</div>
