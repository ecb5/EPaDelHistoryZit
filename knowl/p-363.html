<div class="para">The position of secretary of the section changed dramatically during the 1940s after having been under P. A. Caris’s direction from 1928 to 1941. Indeed, except for the organizational year of 1926, every secretary came from the University of Pennsylvania until 1947. P. M. Whitman succeeded P. A. Caris for three years. He was followed by W. H. Gottschalk for three years and T. A. Botts for one. When Botts (from Delaware) was elected in 1947, it marked the first time the position was not held by someone from Penn since A. A. Bennett held the post in the section’s inaugural year, 1926-1927. Haverford College’s Cletus O. Oakley succeeded Botts and held the office for three years. The position returned to Penn for 1951 and 1952, when R. D. Schafer held it. He was followed by former chair G. C. Webber of the University of Delaware for the next three years.</div>
