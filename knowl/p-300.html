<div class="para">The five talks on geometry during this period dealt with five entirely different aspects of the subject. At the 1940 meeting John Oxtoby was followed by J. L. Vanderslice of Lehigh University, who gave an expository talk on generalizations of classical differential geometry in which he supplied evidence for the indispensability of tensors and tensor differentiation. Two years earlier R. C. Yates of the University of Maryland presented a lecture titled “Linkages”. After presenting a history of the subject from the common pantograph of Scheiner in 1631 to work by J. J. Sylvester, the speaker exhibited several working models of linkages designed for line motion, trisection, and the description of conics and many higher plane curves. Yates would speak to the section again in 1951, at which time he had moved to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In 1934 J. Alfred Benner of Lafayette College spoke about a certain class of curves defined by polar equations.</div>
