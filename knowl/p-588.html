Born in 1921 in St. Johns, Newfoundland, Wilansky remained in Canada for his undergraduate education, his first degree being an M.A. from Dalhousie University in 1944. He then enrolled in the graduate program at Brown University and received his Ph.D. under C. R. Adams three years later for a dissertation titled, “Application of Banach linear functionals to summability”.</div>
