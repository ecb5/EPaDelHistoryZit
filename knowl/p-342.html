<div class="para">We begin the chapter with a summary of the section’s annual meetings, highlighting contributions made by another set of sectional leaders. In addition to profiles of G. C. Webber, Anna Wheeler, and John Oxtoby at the end of the chapter, our chronicle contains biographical sketches of eight other chairs, three secretaries, three members of the Program Committee, and three speakers. Several notable events are reported, including the election of the first woman as chair of the section and the emerging leadership of members from the University of Delaware and Franklin &amp; Marshall College. This period also witnesses vigorous activity by mathematicians from Rutgers and Princeton. Perhaps the most decisive development for the governance of the section was the evolution of the Program Committee from a group of small size and limited charge to today’s expanded, proactive Executive Committee.</div>
