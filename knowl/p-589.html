<div class="para">Wilansky is mostly known as “Tommy”. The origin of this name is obscure; his family thinks it is due to the name of the doctor who delivered him. In 1947 Tommy Wilansky married Ruth Leah Paton, whom he had met at Dalhousie University. They had two daughters, Eleanor and Laura. His daughter Eleanor Myers is a professor at the Temple University School of Law who received a Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2001.</div>
