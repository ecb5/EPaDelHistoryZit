<div class="para">This work chronicles the history of one of those sections during its first 75 years. <a href="Background.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Background">Chapter 1</a> provides a background to the establishment of the section by outlining the formation of the two major mathematical organizations in the country and their sections – the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> and the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS (American Mathematical Society)</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>. <a href="Founding.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Founding">Chapter 2</a> discusses the founding of the Philadelphia Section in November 1926. The Section initially included all of central Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. The next four chapters describe the development of the section into periods defined by external events. The first, 1926-1933, ends with the founding of the Allegheny Section. The second, 1933-1941, includes the role played by émigrés who settled in the area after fleeing their homeland to avoid persecution. The period 1941-1956 begins with wartime activities and ends with the founding of the New Jersey Section. It is followed by a period of immense expansion, 1956-1978. The present name of the section, EPADEL, adopted in late 1978, serves as a divider for the last period, 1978-2000, the focus of <a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a>. In addition, by the mid 1970s it became necessary to add a second annual meeting to the program; the final chapter describes the resulting spring meetings held annually since then.</div>
