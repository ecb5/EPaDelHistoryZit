<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">What teachers must know depends upon the subject matter they will teach. What will be taught depends largely on the caliber of scholar that can be attracted to the teaching of high school mathematics. On the assumption that the high school program will eventually be of the standards shown in the SMSG materials, the teachers must have a five-year training period. Entrance to the program should demand four years (9-12) of high school mathematics study as prerequisite. The four year undergraduate program should consist of calculus and analytic geometry, 12 s.h.; algebra (polynomial, linear, abstract), 6 s.h.; geometry (affine, Euclidean, vector, projective, algebraic), 6 s.h.; probability and statistical inference, 6 s.h.; professionalized subject matter, 6 s.h.; methods of teaching and practice teaching, 6 s.h. The fifth year should include a 3 to 41‚ÅÑ2 s.h. course in each of the following: (a) higher analysis or function theory; (b) theory of numbers; (c) structures, i.e., theory of sets, topology, or vector spaces; (d) logic or non-euclidean geometries; (e) applications, i.e., mathematical physics, econometrics, game theory, statistical analysis, etc.; and (f) history of mathematics. All this should be accompanied by a seminar in mathematical education.</em></div>
