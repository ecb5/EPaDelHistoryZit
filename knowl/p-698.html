<div class="para">Chapter 6 noted that Penn’s Herbert S. Wilf presented the very first lecture in the category <dfn class="terminology">combinatorics/graph</dfn> theory in 1967. He gave two more talks on this topic during the present period: “Some bijective proofs in combinatorics” (1982) and “Finding and proving identities with your computer” (1995). Wilf’s stranglehold was broken in 1997 when Rodica Simion (George Washington) lectured on “The many lives of set partitions”. The same could be said about a 1998 talk by Wilf’s partner in proving identities, Doron Zeilberger, but we categorized the latter talk under computer science.</div>
