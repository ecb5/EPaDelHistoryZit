<div class="para">The 1991 meeting also featured a new element at spring meetings, student paper sessions. Deborah Frantz (Kutztown) moderated two one-hour sessions that ran parallel to lectures given in the morning and the afternoon. The following year Lamarr Widmer (Messiah) ran a 21⁄2-hour session of student papers in the morning session. The theme of that year’s meeting, “Mathematical modeling”, was a reprise of the section’s inaugural spring meeting held at Gettysburg 15 years earlier. Jefferson S. Hartzler (Penn State Harrisburg) began the day with an address whose title was congruent to the day’s theme. His lecture described, inter alia, a junior/senior modeling course developed for Messiah College and his own campus of Penn State. Next David (“Chris”) Arney (United States Military Academy) described the modeling course that formed the core of the four mathematics courses required of all cadets at West Point. After a discussion by Joseph H. Discenza (Daniel Wagner Associates) on modeling aspects of search problems about target a priori location, Ben A. Fusaro ended the day with a lecture on his specialty, environmental modeling. Fusaro included an outline of a six-week module appropriate for a general-education or liberal arts course.</div>
