<div class="para">Sectional leadership expanded and broadened throughout the EPADEL period. Initially, the ten-member Executive Committee – three officers, the section governor, and six members elected at large – planned and implemented all of the section’s activities. Toward the end of the preceding period, the newsletter editor joined the committee ex-officio. Membership burgeoned after that. From 1982 through 1987 the SIG chairman became an ex-officio member. So did the public information officer in 1989. The next year, the coordinators of three programs also came aboard in the same capacity – student chapters, workshops and special events, and visiting lecturer and consultant program. Finally, beginning in 1994, the publisher’s liaison was added to the roll. The tradition of the newsletter editor, PIO, coordinator of student clubs, and publisher’s liaison serving as ex-officio members of the Executive Committee continues today. Although the by-laws permit voting only by elected officials, the Committee has found that over the years a consensus is reached, so formal votes are rarely taken.</div>
