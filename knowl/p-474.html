<div class="para">The meetings in 1956 and 1968 turned out to be critical for the future governance of the section. The by-laws had to be rewritten in 1956 to account for the loss of New Jersey members, and the section took advantage of the opportunity to change its administration. For one thing, it expanded the duties of the secretary to include treasurer as well. In addition, an Executive Committee was defined as consisting of the chairman, secretary-treasurer, governor, and three members-at-large. Thirdly, the relation of the new committee to the former program committee was described: “The executive committee shall constitute the program committee, the senior member being chairman.”</div>
