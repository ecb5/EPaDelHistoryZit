<div class="para">We categorized David Harbater’s 1996 lecture as half algebra – half geometry. Three of the lectures given in the present period were devoted to purely geometrical subjects. Harbater’s Penn colleague Stephen S. Shatz gave an invited lecture 12 years earlier entitled, “Mordell’s conjecture: Ideas and the confluence of arithmetic and geometry”, which seems to suggest an intersection with algebra as well. However, the remaining two talks in topology/geometry were strictly geometric. In 1982 Peter Hilton (SUNY at Binghamton) gave a lecture titled “Descartes, Euler, and polyhedra”. Ten years later Princeton’s John Conway lectured on “Polyhedra and their symmetries” in his inimitable style, replete with physical models to enhance the presentation.</div>
