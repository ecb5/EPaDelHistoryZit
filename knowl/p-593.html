<div class="para">Wilansky has been active in sectional affairs in various ways. For one, he served as chair of the section for 1956-1957. For another, he holds the record for delivering the most invited lectures to the section, five, over a span of 34 years (1950, 1956, 1963, 1970, and 1983). In 1969 the MAA presented him its prestigious Ford Award for a paper he published in Mathematics Magazine. Today these awards recognize authors of articles of expository excellence published in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, but up to <span class="process-math">\(1976\)</span> articles could have been published in <span class="booktitle">Mathematics Magazine</span> as well. Since then, the Allendoerfer Awards – named after another EPADEL leader – recognize outstanding papers written in the latter journal.</div>
