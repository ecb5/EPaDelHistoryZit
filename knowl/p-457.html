<a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a> reported that the annual meeting was held in Delaware for the first time in 1952; it met there again twice in the present period and again in 1980. Haverford hosted two meetings in the present period also, and two prior to the period, but none since then. The 1962 meeting at Franklin &amp; Marshall marked the first time the section met in Lancaster; it would return in 1975 and 1987. Similarly, the 1965 meeting at West Chester marked the first time the section met at one of Pennsylvania’s state teachers colleges. Today the collection of those institutions is called the State System of Higher Education. (The State System of Higher Education consists of 14 universities, with eight located in our section: Bloomsburg, Cheyney, East Stroudsburg, Kutztown, Mansfield, Millersville, Shippensburg, and West Chester). The section also met at West Chester in 1970 and 1982. Several institutions that hosted one meeting in the present period did so for the first time: Millersville University (1978, again in 1989), Muhlenberg College (1956 and 1992) and Villanova University (1966 and 1981). Two institutions hosted an annual meeting for the only time ever: Lebanon Valley College (1972) and Moravian College (1977).</div>
