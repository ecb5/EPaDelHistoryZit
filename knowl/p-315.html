<div class="para">At the tenth meeting of the section in 1935, the first at Lafayette College, the leadoff speaker was Richard P. Bailey from the host institution. His colleague Will Smith, who was chairman of the Section in 1934-1935 and served three terms on the Program Committee in the nine-year period under discussion, introduced him. The section’s secretary, Perry Caris, described Bailey’s talk in one sentence: “Doctor Bailey presented the results of a survey of the mathematics curricula of the colleges of the Philadelphia Section, calling attention in particular to the most prevalent types of curriculum organization and the major problems to which they give rise.” Unfortunately, no further details were provided. Bailey himself had just come to Lafayette that year as an instructor in mathematics, and he remained at Lafayette until 1944. Certainly Secretary Caris knew about Bailey’s work in mathematics, because Bailey had just completed his doctoral dissertation at Penn under James Shohat a few months before delivering his invited lecture to the section.</div>
