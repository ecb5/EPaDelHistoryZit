<div class="para">However, the regional setup turned out to be unnecessarily cumbersome, so in 1945 the Board of Trustees began to phase out the system of regional governors in favor of a system of sectional governors serving three-year terms. The first governor elected from the Philadelphia Section was Emory P. Starke, who, as we have seen, had been an active member of the section from Rutgers. His term ran from July 1, 1947, to June 30, 1950, which overlapped his 1947-1948 term as chairman of the section. The term of the second sectional governor, George E. Raynor, came on the heels of his year as chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1948-1949. Raynorâ€™s successor, Cletus Oakley, began 11 years after he completed his one-year chairmanship of the Philadelphia Section. Incidentally, A. E. Meder (Rutgers) was elected as the first sectional governor of the newly formed New Jersey Section in 1955.</div>
