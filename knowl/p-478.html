<div class="para">In addition to the usual business, two matters occupied most of the leadership’s efforts in 1974. One was a questionnaire designed by Eugene Klotz to ascertain “further information about our constituent institutions, and the interests and problems of our colleagues.” The initial response was small so Klotz sent a gentle reminder to each department in the section that did not respond. “The questionnaire was not meant to be a formidable task; casual estimates, guesses, and even occasional blanks are all quite acceptable responses.” Yet the follow-up garnered only a few more responses. Klotz summarized the results from the sample of 25 departments in a brief memo to a committee headed by Dorothy Wolfe called “A possible organization of the local MAA activities suggested by the questionnaire”. The memo stated three activities: a newsletter, special meetings, and special topics at regular meetings. The latter two areas combined to produce spring meetings, which were first held two years later; they are discussed in detail in <a href="SpringMeetings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Spring Meetings, 1975-2000">Chapter 8</a>.</div>
