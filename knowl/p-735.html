<div class="para">Although the 1981 meeting was ostensibly devoted to computational geometry, the lectures reveal a much broader theme. Initially Philip J. Davis was scheduled to open the meeting with a talk on computer graphics but due to unforeseen circumstances he was replaced by Sandra Fillebrown, who spoke about cryptography. Next, Drexel’s William J. Gordon spoke about “Computer graphics as an aid to problem solving in science and engineering”. His colleague, Oleh J. Tretiak, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, followed lunch with a talk on tomography, a field whose role in CAT scans was only beginning to surface at the time. In the final presentation, cleverly titled, “Is <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span>-math the <span class="process-math">\(\nu\)</span>- math?” Penn’s Albert Nijenhuis demonstrated “a symbolic manipulative program capable of performing symbolic differentiation, integration, and other feats on a digital computer.”</div>
