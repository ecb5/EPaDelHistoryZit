<div class="para">Three of the remaining talks on computer science were presented by distinguished personalities in the field. In 1985 Frank Thomson (Tom) Leighton of the Department of Mathematics and the Lab for Computer Science at MIT spoke on “Networks, parallel computation and VLSI”. At the Sunday meeting the following year Thomas Kurtz (Dartmouth) presented a talk called “Computing in the classroom”. Kurtz is one of the inventors of the language BASIC, which was taught to all undergraduate students at Dartmouth since the late 1950s. The final speaker from this New England troika was recent MAA president-elect Thomas Banchoff (Brown), who in 1991 presented the invited address titled, “Computer graphics and surfaces in four-space: Visualizing characteristic classes”.</div>
