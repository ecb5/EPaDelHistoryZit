</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Walter S. Lawton</dfn> was born in 1906 in Mt. Carmel, PA. He received his A.B. degree from Temple University in 1929, and then obtained two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania: an M.A. in 1930 and a Ph.D. in 1934 (for a dissertation written under former section chair J. A. Shohat). Lawton spent his entire professional career at Temple, from his hiring in 1930 until his retirement 40 years later. He served as chair of the department from 1954 to 1970. During World War II he served his country in the U. S. Naval Reserves from 1942 to 1945. He was nominated as chairman of the section’s Committee on High School Contests in 1957 and was elected chair of the section two years later. The section newsletter reported Temple’s initiation of Lawton Lectureships in 1976 to honor his contributions to the University. It was cryptically recorded there that “Lawton disappeared about six years ago at his summer home in the Poconos.” He was pronounced dead officially in February 1971.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-70" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
