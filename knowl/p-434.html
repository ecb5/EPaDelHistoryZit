<div class="para">Webber signed his name Cuthbert in all his sectional correspondence, but he was generally called Bert at Delaware. Shortly after his death, the University established a “Webber Award” for outstanding achievement in the field of mathematics education. The first award was given in 1983; it has been given every two years since then. The monetary award comes from an endowment left to the University by Mrs. Webber.</div>
