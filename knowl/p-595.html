<a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">ChapterÂ 6</a> described the period of transition in which the local section of the MAA evolved from the Philadelphia Section to EPADEL, the Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section. The name change that officially took place in 1979 was more than cosmetic because it reflected a geographic reality that existed since the formation of the New Jersey Section in 1956. Nonetheless, the section lost the distinction of being the only one named after a city. We have seen that from 1956 to 1978 the character of the section changed from one devoted almost exclusively to the development of mathematics to one that sponsored a variety of activities on pedagogical and curricular themes.</div>
