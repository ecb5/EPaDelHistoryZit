<div class="para">Although in his 50s, the patriotic Bennett volunteered for the Army during World War II, serving as a Major with the Ordnance Corps at Aberdeen once again from 1942 to 1946 and achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Once again he served under Oswald Veblen. One of the more illustrious young mathematicians to work under Bennett at the Ballistic Research Laboratory was Herman Goldstine, who wrote of his superior, “From time to time I was very impatient of Albert Bennett, who was a nice old gentleman—but he was a very precise, methodical, plodding person who drove me up the wall.”</div>
