<div class="para">Schattschneider’s most famous work might be her 1990 book <span class="booktitle">Visions of Symmetry: Notebooks, Periodic Drawings, and Related Work of M. C. Escher</span>. With funding from FIPSE, she joined Dennis Ebersole, Alicia Sevilla, and Kay Somers in developing and disseminating a course that integrates precalculus review with the first course in calculus; this project produced the 1995 text <span class="booktitle">A Companion to Calculus</span>. Schattschneider returned to the mix of art and mathematics in 1996 while serving as a “talking head” to explain Escher’s tessellations on the CD Rom <span class="booktitle">Escher Interactive: Exploring the Art of the Infinite</span>. More recently she was an editor for the 1997 MAA book <span class="booktitle">Geometry Turned On</span>. In that same year she was interviewed live for a radio program in honor of the Canadian geometer H. S. M. Coxeter; a cassette from the program is available in the Reeves Library at Moravian. Her current project is editing a book of 40 articles that resulted from the 1998 Escher Centennial Congress in Rome.</div>
