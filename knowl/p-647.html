<div class="para">The section derived great benefits from a cadre of leaders during this <span class="process-math">\(22\)</span>-year period, including <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> different presidents, one additional vice-president, three additional secretary-treasurers, and four additional section governors. These 19 officers were affiliated with 15 different institutions, with only Drexel, Gettysburg, Moravian, and Wilkes being home to more than one office holder.  The officers represent a wide geographic area, ranging from Wilkes (Wong and Berard) in the north to Delaware (Baxter) in the south, and from Lehigh (King) in the east to Shippensburg (Ensley) in the west.</div>
