<div class="para">In addition to the two focal points, various other locations within the Philadelphia Section were strongly represented at the joint meeting. Seven faculty members from the Pennsylvania State College [now University] attended, including the married couple Frederick W. and Helen B. Owens. Frederick’s affiliation is listed academically (Pennsylvania State College), whereas Helen’s is listed geographically (State College). Both participated actively in events sponsored by the Philadelphia Section even beyond the formation of a section in western Pennsylvania.</div>
