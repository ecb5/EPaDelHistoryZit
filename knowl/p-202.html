<div class="para">In 1932, four years after his first talk to the section, Orrin Frink spoke on measure theory. He began his lecture by noting deficiencies in the definitions of measure given by Jordan, Borel, Lebesgue, Caratheodory, and Hausdorff, then introduced a result by von Neumann that enabled a measurable function to be defined for all sets. During Frink’s talk he referred to Banach’s use of bounded linear and planar sets, an indication of the section’s acquaintance with the emerging specialty in functional analysis, but Frink never mentioned Banach’s development of linear operators.</div>
