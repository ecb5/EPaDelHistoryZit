<div class="para">The final column of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table2.html" title="Table 3.2.1: ">Table 3.2.1</a> lists the members of the Program Committee, which came into existence at the second meeting, held in November 1927. Two years later it was decided to make the section’s chairman an ex-officio member of the committee. As the name connotes, the Program Committee was charged with planning the program for the next year’s annual meeting. In 1953 it evolved into the Executive Committee; in 1968 the newly created post of vice-chairman was put in charge of organizing annual meetings.</div>
