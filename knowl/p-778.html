<div class="para">I seem to have a habit of putting my foot in my mouth. This past summer I received a phone call from David Hill asking that I prepare a 15-20 minute talk in recognition of the 75 th anniversary of the Association. I agreed. Thinking that it would be an easy task, I put it on the back burner till the middle of October. Knowing I could not procrastinate further I began to look for sources for the material for this talk. I thought for a moment of individuals who are older than I, and who were always present at annual meetings of the Section. I thought immediately of John Oxtoby, of Bryn Mawr and called him. He provided me with some information that I reconfirmed. I called Al Filano and talked with him. I then called Kay Somers, Secretary of the Section. She replied that the books of the section do not go back much beyond my tenure as Secretary. I don’t know what that means! Did I lose the history of the section? Well, anyway, where do I turn? I called Jane Heckler, Executive Assistant of MAA. She supplied me with some remarks recorded in “The MAA: It’s First Fifty Years”. I finally turned to <span class="booktitle">The Monthly</span> and the major portion of this talk is taken from Reports of the Sections.</div>
