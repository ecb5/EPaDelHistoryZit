<dfn class="terminology">Theodore Hailperin</dfn> was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1915. He received a B.S. from Michigan in 1939 and a Ph.D. four years later at Cornell for the dissertation, “A set of axioms for logic”, written under Barkley Rosser. Hailperin taught at Cornell for one year after completing his doctorate, and then he worked at the Ballistic Research Laboratory for two years. He went to Lehigh in 1946 and, apart from a year’s absence as Research Associate with Sandia Laboratory, spent the rest of his academic career there. Hailperin directed four Ph.D. dissertations on foundations between 1961 and 1975. After retirement in 1980 he was appointed adjunct professor, supervising the mathematics offerings at Lehigh’s Learning Center. He resigned from that position in 1996. He and his wife Ruth are now retired (she from Moravian) and living in Nazareth, PA.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Albert William Tucker</dfn> o(1905-1995) was born in Oshawa, Canada. He obtained a B.A. at the University of Toronto in 1928 and then two degrees at Princeton University: M.A. 1929 and Ph.D. 1932 (under the famous topologist, Solomon Lefschetz). Tucker joined the faculty at Princeton the next year and taught there until his retirement in 1974. Known for his seminal contributions to linear and non-linear programming and to game theory, he held Princeton’s prestigious Dod Professorship from 1954 until 1974. Tucker’s first Ph.D. student (in 1950) was John Nash, a Nobel Prize winner in economics. He also directed the 1972 dissertation of our own active member, Stephen Maurer. Two other Tucker mathematical products are his sons Thomas W. Tucker (Colgate) and Alan C. Tucker (SUNY - Stony Brook); the latter spoke to our section in 1982. A. W. Tucker died in Princeton at age 89.</div></li>
