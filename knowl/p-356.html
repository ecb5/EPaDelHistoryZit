<div class="para">Like the University of Delaware, Rutgers provided the section with two chairmen whose terms were separated by three years. At Rutgers, however, C. A. Nelson (New Jersey College for Women, Rutgers University) and E. P. Starke (Rutgers University) represented two separate divisions within the same institution. Nelson was elected chair of the section in 1944, and Starke in 1947. Nelson again served as chair in 1952-1953. Recall that Richard Morris of Rutgers was the first person from New Jersey to be elected to the office in 1934.</div>
