<div class="para">Three of the four talks at the 1947 meeting at Bryn Mawr were delivered by people who accepted multiple invitations to speak at the section’s annual meetings. The day began with the first of Nathan Fine’s three lectures, “On Walsh functions,” based on his 1946 dissertation with the same title written under the supervision of A. Zygmund. The afternoon session featured F. D. Murnaghan’s second lecture, on vector methods in teaching trigonometry and geometry. He had spoken three years earlier on an article published in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, “The uniform tension of an elastic cylinder”. The final presentation of the day was the third talk by the Princeton statistician S. S. Wilks, who accompanied his remarks on statistical inference “with material on slides”. This is the only mention of such technology in the history of the section.</div>
