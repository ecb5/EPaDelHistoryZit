<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table18.html" title="Table 7.1.1: ">Table 7.1.1</a> provides an overview of EPADEL’s 22 annual fall meetings held from 1979 to 2000. Unlike the analogous tables in earlier chapters, there is no column providing references to the official annual reports from the Monthly because of changes that took place in the journal. Starting in 1981, section reports were moved from a Monthly column called “Mathematical Association of America” to a new Center Section of the journal. But that policy lasted only four years. In 1986 the Center Section no longer carried section reports, only telegraphic reviews. Even the Center Section disappeared the next year. In short, section reports were not made public after 1985. The interested reader might consult the Monthly for reports on meetings held from 1979 to 1984, yet we hasten to add that these reports listed only elected officers and invited addresses. To compound matters, the report of the 1979 meeting at Drexel appears twice, the one from the 1978 meeting never appeared at all, and the journal’s index is unreliable. Even attendance was reported sporadically, often carrying the qualifier “approximately”, although in general, attendance figures were in line with those reported from meetings held in the 1970s.</div>
