<div class="para">Altogether 76 different lecturers delivered the 81 invited talks, providing yet another indication of the impressively diverse mix of invited speakers the section was able to attract. The five lecturers who spoke twice during the EPADEL period were William Dunham (Muhlenberg), Ronald Graham (AT&amp;T), Paul Halmos (Indiana), Jerry King (Lehigh), and Herbert Wilf (Penn). Of the five repeat speakers, only Wilf had spoken at a meeting before this period. As noted earlier, Wilf is one of only five people to deliver four invited talks to the section. The all-time leader with five talks is Albert Wilansky.</div>
