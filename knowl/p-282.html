<div class="para">Princeton’s Salomon Bochner was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1899. He was forced to leave his position of lecturer in Munich, Germany, in 1932, and just one year later Oswald Veblen arranged a faculty appointment for Bochner at Princeton. Two years after that, in Bochner’s 1935 talk to the Philadelphia Section, he presented an outline of the theory of periodic and almost-periodic functions as viewed from the theory of expansions of general functions on groups. He emphasized that his approach explained adequately why the exponentials formed a complete system of pure periodic functions of one variable. We do not know the cause of James Shohat’s emigration from Russia in 1923 but there is no doubt why Salomon Bochner left Poland – to avoid the Nazi persecution of Jews. Bochner always remained grateful to the United States for saving his life.</div>
