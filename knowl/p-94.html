<div class="para">Although we were unable to locate personal items about the remaining charter member, some of the professional activities of <em class="alert">John Albert Foberg</em> are worth noting because they link the section to current developments in mathematics education. J. A. Foberg graduated from the University of Illinois and taught at Crane Junior College in Chicago when he became a charter member of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-80-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> upon its founding in 1915. One year later he was selected to be the representative from the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers to the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements. This committee was formed by the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-81-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> “to give national expression to the movement for reform in the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools and colleges.” Foberg and J. W. Young (Dartmouth) received funds to devote the entire year 1919-1920 to writing reports for the committee. Foberg’s report, “Junior High School Mathematics”, appeared at the end of the year. Three years earlier he had been one of the organizers of the Illinois Section of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-82-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a>. A 1972 <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-83-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a> publication reported, “It is worth noting, in this day of expansion of the junior college concept, that the first chairman of the Section was J. A. Foberg of Crane Junior College.” When the NCTM was founded in the early part of 1920 Foberg was elected its first secretary-treasurer. He also became the business manager for the NCTM’s official journal, The Mathematics Teacher. During this time he moved to Pennsylvania to become the State Director of Science and Mathematics, the position he held when the Philadelphia Section was founded in 1926. The preceding year he published the book General High School Mathematics with D. E. Smith and W. D. Reeve from Columbia Teachers College. Foberg later completed his Ph.D. at the University of Pittsburgh. He then left the Department of Public Instruction to become the head of the mathematics department at California State College. He appears to have lived in Camp Hill during his entire stay in the state. He was last listed in <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-84-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.12"><sup> 12 </sup></a> membership rolls for the academic year 1937-1938.</div>
