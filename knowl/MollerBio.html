After a start on the tenure track at DeSales University, Trisha transitioned to full-time mom and part-time professor with the birth of her two sons. Trisha has held many positions on the EPADEL executive committee such as Section NExT coordinator, chair of the Committee on the Session for New Colleagues, Student Speaker Coordinator, Public Information Officer, and organizer of the 2005 EPADEL Student Career Conference. Trisha is a 2004 MAA Project NExT fellow, and in 2011, she earned the AAUW Bethlehem Emerging Star Award.
