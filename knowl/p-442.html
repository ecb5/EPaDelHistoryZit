<div class="para">However, Pell soon married again, this time to Arthur Wheeler, a professor of classics at Princeton University. Residing in Princeton forced her to resign her administrative duties at Bryn Mawr, but she continued to teach there on a part- time basis. The Wheelers enjoyed summer vacations at their summer home in the Adirondack Mountains called “Q.E.D”. Unfortunately, her second husband died in 1932. After this Anna Pell Wheeler returned to live and teach full time at Bryn Mawr. The next year she was instrumental in attracting Emmy Noether to the faculty, a hiring that brought an air of excitement and international prestige to the Main Line campus. Unfortunately Pell’s colleague and good friend Noether died unexpectedly in 1935, less than two years after arriving.</div>
