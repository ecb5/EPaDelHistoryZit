<div class="para">Clearly EPADEL student chapters were in enthusiastic and energetic hands. The number of chapters in the section grew to 20 in 1991 and leveled out at 24 by 1996. Throughout the 1990s students were kept abreast of competitions (Putnam, Modeling, and Problem-Solving in addition to our own section’s contest), opportunities for involvement at the two annual MAA meetings, Pi Mu Epsilon meetings, the magazine Math Horizons, and the NSF program in Research Experiences for Undergraduates. In addition to these activities, Deb Frantz initiated a series of biennial conferences called “Careers in Mathematics”, which have met at Kutztown (in 1991), Lebanon Valley (1993), Messiah (1995), Millersville (1997), and East Stroudsburg (1999). Those conferences garnered national interest as early as 1991. EPADEL President David Hill wrote, “The ‘Careers in Mathematics’ student conference coordinated by Deborah Frantz was an outstanding success and generated national interest.” Inspired by the success of this endeavor, Douglas Ensley initiated a series of annual Student Mathematics Conferences at his home institution, Shippensburg, in 1996. After a decade of excellent leadership, Frantz handed the mantle of leadership to Alicia Sevilla (Moravian) in the year 2000.</div>
