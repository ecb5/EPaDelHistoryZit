<div class="para">Reynoldsâ€™ connection to theoretical mechanics is reflected in four of the six books he wrote. The first one, Elementary Mechanics, was published in 1928 and revised six years later. In between those editions he published Analytic Mechanics in 1931. It took eight more years to write Forty Lessons in Analytic Mechanics (1939), suggesting five lessons per year. His last book, Elements of Mechanics, written with his colleague, G. E. Raynor, was published in 1943.</div>
