<dfn class="terminology">Dennis Michael DeTurck</dfn> is a native Philadelphian who took all of his degrees in the city. Before receiving his bachelors degree from Drexel in 1976 he was awarded the munificent sum of $12 from the section for achieving the highest score on the Putnam exam of any undergraduate within its boundaries. DeTurck then entered the graduate program at Penn, earning a masters degree in 1978 and a Ph.D. two years later. In his dissertation, written under Jerry L. Kazdan, DeTurck constructed a local theory for metrics having prescribed Ricci tensors. Following graduation he went to the Courant Institute as a post-doctoral instructor for two years. He returned to Penn after that and has remained there since 1982. DeTurck was promoted to full professor in 1989. He was the 1991 winner of the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching; four years later he was appointed to the Davidson Kennedy Professorship as a reward for successful undergraduate teaching. (One of Penn’s undergraduate students won the 2001 EPADEL Undergraduate Research Award.) DeTurck served as undergraduate chair of the department 1992-1997 and was elected chair in 1997. During his tenure he has directed six doctoral and two masters dissertations. DeTurck was an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> for ten years, <span class="process-math">\(1986-1996\text{.}\)</span> During that time he was elected to the EPADEL Executive Committee for two three-year terms. Finally, DeTurck won the section’s Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Hanson Matthew Umoh</dfn> came to the U.S. in 1970 from his native Nigeria, where he studied at the Federal School and Science in Lagos. Umoh earned a B.S. degree in mathematics from Virginia Union and an M.A. in mathematics from Morgan State. He accepted an instructorship at Howard University in 1981. While teaching he also took graduate courses there, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1988; he had been promoted to assistant professor the previous year. However, upon graduation he accepted an assistant professorship at Delaware State University, where he has remained ever since.</div></li>
