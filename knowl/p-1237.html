<div class="para">The Section benefited before 1956, when the New Jersey Section was formed, by having expository talks by members of the Princeton faculty. Indeed, A.W. Tucker’s presentation in 1948, “Geometric Approaches to The Theory of Games”, was an extremely timely talk. R.H. Fox spoke twice. His titles were “Homotopy Groups” and “The Logical Development of Knot Theory.” Emil Artin, William Feller, and J.C. Moore also of that faculty presented papers at November meetings.</div>
