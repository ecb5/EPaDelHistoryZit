<div class="para">With the advent of the Apple II microcomputer the following year, Porter saw at once that educational uses on the mainframe were obsolete. He applied for an NSF grant to increase substantially the number of microcomputers on campus and to provide support for faculty to develop programs for their use in education, but by 1981 a change in presidential priorities essentially put NSF out of the education business. Nonetheless, Porter’s involvement in the proposal led the dean to ask him to be the second associate dean for computing in the School of Arts and Sciences. Porter served in that position for ten years. This activity caused MAA president Lynn Steen to ask him to chair CCIME, resulting in a spate of talks around the country on the use of computers in undergraduate mathematics education. In 1989 he organized the EPADEL spring meeting on “The role of Computer Algebra Systems in teaching mathematics”.</div>
