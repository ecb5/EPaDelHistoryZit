<div class="para">The last part of the chapter considers the 56 presentations made during this 14-year period. Unlike earlier chapters, a chronological account precedes the customary analysis by mathematical classification. The lectures clearly reflect the influence of the Penn School of Analysis. They also reflect the emphasis placed on applications at meetings held during World War II and on educational issues at meetings held afterwards. One presentation in 1954 was particularly noteworthy, both because its format preceded the panel discussions that gained popularity afterwards and because it dealt with a new technology â€“ television.</div>
