<div class="para">No longer was the Penn School of Analysis responsible for the continued dominance of talks on analysis. In fact, Penn faculty gave only three of the 14 talks in this category. I. J. Schoenberg gave two – “Mass distributions on the circle and convex conformal maps” (1957) and “On spline interpolation” (1963). N. J. Fine gave the other, “Integrability of continuous functions” (1963). The most popular topic in analysis was differential equations, which was chosen by Solomon Lefschetz (in 1960), William Feller (1964), J. P. Diaz (1968), and Louis Nirenberg (1971).</div>
