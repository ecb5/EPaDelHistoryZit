<div class="para">In addition to works on mechanics, Reynolds and his colleague Frank M. Weida published Analytic Geometry and the Elements of Calculus in 1930. (Another successful calculus author from Lehigh was Lloyd L. Smail.) Overall Reynolds published three other books between 1918 and 1935, one of which appeared in two editions. The remaining work not yet described is The Peter Reynolds Family of Lawrence County Pennsylvania, which he published in 1940.</div>
