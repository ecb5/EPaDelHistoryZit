<dfn class="terminology">David Edwin Flesner</dfn> was born in Indiana. He received his A.B. at Wittenberg University in 1966 before enrolling in the graduate program at the University of Michigan, where he obtained an A.M. (1968) and Ph.D. (1971). His dissertation – on maximal subgroups of four-dimensional symplectic groups in characteristic two – was written under Jack E. McLaughlin. Upon receiving his doctorate, Flesner came to Gettysburg College and has remained there ever since. He became chair of the department in 1999. His book Aging and the Aged: Problems, Opportunities, Challenges (edited with Edwin D. Freed) was published in 1980. For several years after that he directed an interdepartmental senior honors Seminar on Aging and the Aged. He also took part in a project at Maryland involving applications of group theory in chemistry and physics. In 2000, Flesner completed a toolbar package to implement the Klein model of hyperbolic geometry within the Cabri Geometry software.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">David Ross Hill</dfn> is a native of Homestead, PA, who received a B.S. degree in education from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and an M.A. in mathematics from the State University of New York at Buffalo two years later. He spent the year 1966-1967 as a computer analyst with Koppers Corp. in Pittsburgh before entering the graduate program at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received his Ph.D. in 1973. His dissertation on numerical solutions of delay differential equations was written under the supervision of George D. Byrne. Hill joined the faculty at Pittsburgh as an associate instructor during the last two years of graduate school. Upon receiving his doctorate he accepted an assistant professorship at Temple University, where he has been since, except for a visiting position at the College of the Virgin Islands in 1980. During his tenure he directed two masters theses. Hill has been a principal investigator on three major grants – two from the NSF (one with D. Zitarelli established linear algebra as a lab course in 1990) and one from FIPSE (to produce an interactive text for linear algebra with G. Porter). In 1988 Hill presented a mini-course on MATLAB at the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-178-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> summer meeting in Providence, R.I, and in 1995 he delivered a one-hour invited address at the annual MAA meeting on teaching linear algebra with technology. In addition to talks at the EPADEL spring meetings in 1986 and 1995, he has been an invited lecturer in Holland, England, and the Czech Republic. He also taught a short course at Messiah College sponsored by EPADEL in 1990. His expertise in teaching with computers led him to conduct numerous workshops – at the Northeastern Section of the MAA in 1994, the MAA MathFest in Seattle in 1996, and the NSF-sponsored ATLAST Project from 1992 through 1996. Hill is the author of several successful textbooks, including three with Bernard Kolman. In addition, he was the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching Award at Temple in 1996.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Nancy Lineken Hagelgans</dfn> was born in Burlington, Vermont. She received an A.B. from Goucher College in 1956 before entering the graduate program at Johns Hopkins, earning an M.A. three years later. Hagelgans taught at two Baltimore institutions (Goucher 1967-1968 and Towson State 1967- 1972) before moving to the EPADEL area. While teaching at Haverford from 1975 to 1977 she decided to complete her doctorate at Hopkins. Her supervisor, Jean-Pierre Meyer, suggested that James Stasheff of Temple might act as her advisor. He did, and Hagelgans completed her dissertation on local spaces with three cells as H-spaces in 1977. She spent 1977-1978 at Bryn Mawr, all the while searching for a tenure-track position. Since it seemed that the only openings involved computer science she completed an M.S. in that field at Villanova in 1979. In 1978 Hagelgans landed a tenure- track position at Ursinus in both mathematics and computer science. She has remained there ever since, except for the year 1986-1987 spent as a visiting professor at the University of Delaware. She served as the department chair at Ursinus 1988-1992 and resumed that post in January 2001. Hagelgans was elected to a three-year term on the EPADEL Executive Committee in 1986, when she also began coordinating the Consultants and Speakers Program. In addition to four years as president and vice president, she was elected to a three-year term as governor 1995-1998. She also was an invited speaker at the section’s spring meeting in 1996 on one of her specialties, cooperative learning in discrete mathematics. Along this line, she is one of the authors of the book <span class="booktitle">A Practical Guide to Cooperative Learning in Collegiate Mathematics</span>, published in 1995 as MAA Notes Number 37. Hagelgans has been active in the national MAA in many other ways – serving on the Committee on Consultants (1997-1999), the task force on the MAA publication <span class="booktitle">Guidelines for Programs and Departments in Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences</span> (1997-2000), the Professional Development Committee (1998-2001), and the Committee on Sections (1999-2002). She has also been involved in Project NexT as a mentor since 1995, as a workshop presenter in 1996, and as a panelist in 1998 and 1999.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Walter Rees Stromquist</dfn> possesses very strong mathematical genes. His father, Walter Kellogg Stromquist (1917-1999), was a nuclear engineer with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Tennessee. WKS worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory when his son WRS was born. WKS’s uncle, Carl Eben Stromquist (1877-1925), received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale in 1903 and was on the faculty at Princeton 1903-1909. CES then moved to the University of Wyoming, where he remained until ill health forced him to resign in 1922. During this time he was a charter member of the MAA in 1915 and one of the organizing members of the Rocky Mountain Section of the MAA two years later. EPADEL chair Walter Rees Stromquist received his B.A. from the University of Kansas in 1970 before enrolling in the graduate program at Harvard, where he earned two degrees – an M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1975. His dissertation on the four-color problem was written under the supervision of Andrew Gleason. Stromquist did not restrict himself to mathematics during his stay at Harvard, however, electing graduate courses in economics and tax law. Thus it is not particularly surprising that his first professional experience was with the Office of Tax Analysis in the U.S. Treasury, where he worked 1973-1977. In 1979 Stromquist accepted a position with Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, ultimately rising to become vice president of the company before leaving in 1998 to become an independent consultant. During his tenure he was a visiting professor at Temple 1987-1988; he also taught as an adjunct professor at Bryn Mawr, Eastern College (in economics), George Washington, and West Point (as an Army reservist). Stromquist served as a member of the section’s Executive Committee 1987-1991 before being elected to stints as vice president and president. At the national level, Stromquist was elected MAA Governor at Large for Industry and Government in 2000 and served as an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> <span class="process-math">\(1996-2001\text{.}\)</span>

<dfn class="terminology">Louise McNertney Berard</dfn> is a native of Hazleton, PA. She received her bachelors degree from King’s College in 1975 and her Ph.D. from Brown University five years later. Her dissertation, “One-Parameter Families of Surfaces with Constant Curvature in Lorentz <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-Space”, was the second one written under the supervision of MAA president Thomas F. Banchoff. Berard accepted a position at Wilkes University upon receiving her doctorate. She has remained there ever since, serving as chair 1992-1996. She received the Carpenter Outstanding Teacher Award at Wilkes in 1988. In addition to being elected president and vice president of EPADEL for two years each, Berard served as the coordinator of the section’s Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program 1992-1995.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Kay Bergstresser Somers</dfn> is a native of Fountain Hill, PA. After receiving her bachelors degree from Ursinus in 1968 she worked for a year as a statistical research analyst with the NY State Department of Mental Hygiene. Then she enrolled in the graduate program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, earning a masters degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. two years later. Her dissertation, “A generalization of strong unicity”, was written under the supervision of Harry McLaughlin. Kay Somers then was a visiting lecturer at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University before accepting an assistant professorship at Lafayette in 1975. She left there in 1979 to work as an operations research analyst with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Somers moved to Moravian College in 1981 and has remained there ever since, serving as chair 1992-1998. In addition to being elected president and vice president of EPADEL, she also served as secretary-treasurer for six years. In addition, she was an invited speaker at annual meeting of the Michigan Section of the MAA in 1994. At the national level, Somers was a member of the MAA Ad Hoc Committee to review the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> in <span class="process-math">\(1999\text{.}\)</span> Two of her students have won MAA student paper contests.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Douglas Edward Ensley</dfn> was born in Phenix City, Alabama. After earning a B.S. degree from the University of Alabama at Huntsville in 1986, Ensley moved north to enroll in the graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University. He received an M.S. degree two years later and a Ph.D. in 1993 for a dissertation on measures on categorical structures written under the supervision of Michael Albert. Upon receiving his degree, Ensley moved to Shippensburg, where he became a 1993 project NExT fellow. He served as assistant chair at Shippensburg 1995-1999. Summers found him back in Pittsburgh, however, as the mathematics instructor for the Pennsylvania Governor’s School of the Sciences (PGSS) held at Carnegie Mellon. His contributions were recognized by the PGSS with an Exemplary Service Award in 1996. In addition to serving EPADEL as president and vice president, Ensley volunteered in two other capacities, coordinating the Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program 1995-1999 and directing (with Joanne Darken) Project NExT 2000-2001. In his short career Ensley has also been active with the MAA, serving as a Visiting Mathematician during the fall of 2000. This led to his being appointed editor of the MAA Digital Classroom Resources, a part of the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library. Winning a graduate student teaching award at Carnegie Mellon in 1993 foreshadowed successful teaching at Shippensburg, as three of his students have won MAA awards for student paper presentations at two different Mathfests.</div></li>
