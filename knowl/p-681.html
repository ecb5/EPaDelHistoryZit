<div class="para">This period was witness to one dramatic development: talks in analysis no longer dominated the programs, as they had done in every period heretofore. In fact, the EPADEL period showed an almost even distribution among speakers in the three main areas of mathematics: algebra/number theory (11.5), topology/geometry (10.5), and analysis (9). The fractional part comes from David Harbater’s 1996 talk, “Symmetry in algebra and geometry”. This period also reflects three other noteworthy changes. For one, there were a dozen talks related primarily to educational themes, continuing the section’s involvement with the central concern that manifested itself in the 1950s. Second, 10 lectures were devoted to topics in the history of mathematics, the most ever. Third, eight lectures discussed computer science. On a related note, the EPADEL period bore witness to six talks on applications.</div>
