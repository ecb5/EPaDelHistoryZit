<div class="para">Doris Schattschneider is one of the EPADEL’s most decorated members. Born in New York City to Robert and Charlotte (Ingalls) Wood, she took her undergraduate degree in 1961 from the University of Rochester. She then enrolled in the graduate program at Yale. One year later she married David E. Schattschneider. The newlyweds moved to Northwestern that year because David had won a Danforth internship there, so Doris spent the 1962-1963 academic year as a graduate student there as well. At the end of the year she received an M.A. degree from Yale. When David next moved to Chicago to embark on his Ph.D. program, Doris called Ralph Boas to ask if there were any openings. She recalled, “Two days later he phoned me to say I had a job as instructor.” So Doris taught at Northwestern for the 1964-1965 academic year before moving to the nearby University of Illinois at Chicago campus, where she taught until 1968.</div>
