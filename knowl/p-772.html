<div class="para">Porterâ€™s work on interactive texts is but one point in a long line of activity regarding the role of computers in undergraduate education. We pursue the outline of this line to show that life is really a journey rather than a sequence of isolated events. The journey began in the summers of 1955 and 1956, when Porter worked in a large insurance company that had just gotten its first computer, an IBM 650. This led to a summer job with IBM in 1957 writing subroutines to calculate trig functions and a part time job during the academic year at the Institute for Advanced Studies as the night operator of the Von Neumann computer. For his Princeton senior thesis his advisor, Harold Kuhn, proposed a set of initial states and wanted to know which one provided the best way to begin, so Porter used the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to solve linear programming problems on an electronic computer. (In so doing, Porter may have been the first Princeton undergraduate to use a computer on his senior thesis.)</div>
