<div class="para">Our Association was founded under especially auspicious circumstances. The many favorable factors were not accidents, nor miracles, nor achieved through serendipity. Some were the end results of a chain of events, not always desired, not always with the eventual outcome in view. But in large part they were secured through wise planning, tactful compromise, cajoling of the apathetic, courageous facing of pessimists in high places, and unremitting work.</div>
