<div class="para">The first panel discussion was held in 1979. Its theme, “The machine in the garden: The relationship of computer sciences and the undergraduate mathematics major”, remains as relevant today as it was two decades ago. The three panelists were John Kellett (Gettysburg), John Koch (Wilkes), and Walter Brown (Moravian). The panel discussion conducted three years later, “CUPM recommendations”, was moderated by Gerald Porter (Penn) and included Joerg Mayer (Lebanon Valley) and Larry E. Sigler (Bucknell). In 1989 the panel discussion was titled “A model of an undergraduate research program in mathematics”. The program for the meeting lists only two speakers, Fred Schultheis (Moravian) and Clifford Reiter (Lafayette). The theme of the final panel in the section’s history, held in 1992, was “Encouraging participation among underrepresented groups”. This panel was a sequel to the section’s special session organized by Joanne S. Darken two years earlier. Along with Darken (Community College of Philadelphia,) the other panelists were Charles M. Grinstead (Swarthmore), Elizabeth W. McMahon (Lafayette), and Allen R. Schweinsberg (Bucknell).</div>
