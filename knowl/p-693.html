<div class="para">Distinguished historians delivered five of the remaining lectures on the history of mathematics. In 1985 Ann Hibner Koblitz (University of Washington) read the paper, “The mythification of Sofia Kovalevskaya”. The very next year V. Frederick Rickey (Bowling Green) answered many a question asked by calculus teachers everywhere in his talk, “The invention of calculus: Who, what, when, where, and why?” Just two years later Harold Edwards, of the Courant Institute at NYU, spoke about “Kronecker’s views of the foundations of mathematics”. In 1995 Marcia Ascher, recently retired from Ithaca College, presented “Tracings in the sand: An introduction to ethnomathematics”, while three years after that James Tattersall (Providence College) showed some “Mathematical vignettes from Cambridge University”.</div>
