<div class="para">Two of the four speakers came from the EPADEL section, with Louise’s husband, Anthony D. Berard, Jr. (King’s College), leading off the program. His lecture, “Applying logic/designing small axiom systems”, described a course in which students worked in small groups in class to develop proofs together. He ended his talk by supplying an example of an axiom system designed by first- semester students. In the final talk of the day Nancy L. Hagelgans (Ursinus), the former section president who was then the section’s governor, discussed “Cooperative learning in discrete mathematics”. This talk described a sophomore-level course in which students solved problems in three different settings – using a computer algebra system by participating in groups during class, in the computer laboratory, and outside scheduled hours. In the remaining two lectures, E. Jacquelin Dietz (North Carolina State) presented two hands-on activities that were developed to teach the concept of sampling distribution, while Richard W. Decker (Hamilton College) described an introductory survey course in computer science in his presentation “A suite of hands-on laboratory exercises”.</div>
