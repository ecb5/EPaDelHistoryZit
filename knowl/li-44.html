<em class="alert">Albert George Rau</em> (1868-1942) is the only person to speak to our section who was a full-time administrator his whole professional life. Born on August 7, 1868, in Bethlehem, PA, Rau obtained his bachelors degree from Lehigh University in 1888. In spite of graduating shortly before his 20th birthday, Rau assumed the position of Superintendent of the Moravian Preparatory School that September. He remained in that post until 1909, when he was appointed Dean of the Moravian College and Theological Seminary. Rau attended school in the evening, resulting in a masters degree from Lehigh in 1900 and a Ph.D. from Moravian in 1910. His publications show a wide breadth of interest, a trait reflected in his professional memberships. Rau not only belonged to the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-170-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> and the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-171-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, but to the American Society for Political and Social Science, perhaps being the only member in the intersection of these three sets. Except for a one-year leave as lecturer on rural sociology at the Teachers College of Columbia University in 1927, Rau retained his deanship until his death on February 23, 1942.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-23.html#li-44" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
