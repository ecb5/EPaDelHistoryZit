<div class="para">Wilansky published numerous papers in analysis (especially summability), linear topological spaces, Banach algebras, and functional analysis. He is also the author of several books in these fields. His first, Functional Analysis, appeared in 1964. Three years later a book based on lecture notes from a graduate course he offered, Topics in Functional Analysis, was published by one of his doctoral students, William D. Laverell. Wilansky’s Topology for Analysis was first published in 1970; the second edition appeared in 1983. His Modern Methods in Topological Vector Spaces appeared in 1978. A manuscript stored in the library at Lehigh indicates that the intended title of this work was going to be Topological Vector Spaces. As the author stated, “It will continue to say ‘Modern’ forever.” Wilansky’s last book appeared in 1984, Summability Through Functional Analysis.</div>
