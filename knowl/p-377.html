<div class="para">Institutional affiliations are as diverse as the range of speakers, with 18 different institutions accounting for the 58 presenters. Once again the University of Pennsylvania led the way, with 10 speakers, followed by Bryn Mawr College and Princeton University (7 each), Lehigh University and the University of Delaware (5 each), Haverford College and the Institute for Advanced Study (4 each), and Swarthmore College (3). The preceding chapter noted that only once in the section’s 75-year history were there lectures by two individuals from the same institution at the same fall meeting. That happened in 1952 when the University of Delaware’s Russell Remage and E. V. Lewis spoke. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Penn’s 10 lectures in the present period were delivered in 10 different years. It is relevant to point out that a total of 13 speakers came from institutions located in New Jersey because that state formed its own section in 1956, the last year of the period under discussion.</div>
