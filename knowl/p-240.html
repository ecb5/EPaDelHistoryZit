<div class="para">Kline obtained an A.B. in 1912 from Muhlenberg College, which granted him an honorary doctorate in 1934. A photo of the college on the front page of the May 30, 1934, edition of the Allentown Chronicle includes him as one of the inset faces. Back in 1912 Kline went directly from Muhlenberg to the graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania. The preceding year two new instructors on the Penn faculty were EPADEL founder H. H. Mitchell and R. L. Moore. Apparently Kline took two courses with Moore – Foundations of Mathematics, and a sequel called Theory of Point Sets. Beyond these, individual study was the fashion, with Moore encouraging his better students to work with him. Kline was the best. He obtained a masters degree in 1914 and a Ph.D. two years later. His dissertation, “Double elliptic geometry in terms of point and order”, was published in the Annals of Mathematics in September 1916. This makes Kline the first in a long, distinguished list of doctoral students of the legendary Texan.</div>
