<div class="para">Smail and Smith lectured on topics from an undergraduate analysis course. Smail, who became known for his highly successful calculus book, presented material at the boundary of graduate and undergraduate education. He introduced a modified form of Dedekind’s definition of irrational numbers to treat rational and irrational exponents and logarithms without explicit use of the theory of limits. Smith’s topic fit neatly into the undergraduate curriculum as enrichment material for the usual course in differential equations. He presented an expository account of the derivation of various kinds of differential equations, including the Riccati equation, equations of forced, damp vibrations, and certain others with solutions “arising from a kind of maintained vibration in which the force of restitution ... is subject to an imposed periodic variation.”</div>
