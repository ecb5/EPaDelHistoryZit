<div class="para">The presentation by Haverford College’s Albert H. Wilson was similar to Fort’s in that his topic has never been part of the mathematical mainstream, and so can be considered as an enrichment topic. Nonetheless, this author wishes that Wilson’s talk could have been taped, for it must have been a sight to behold. He began his lecture by discussing tilings of the plane, a topic that received a major boost in the 1970s with the work of the Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Our own Doris Schattschneider of Moravian College has added immensely to the popularization of this topic and to our understanding and appreciation of it. Unlike Schattschneider, however, Wilson restricted his tilings to polygons, enumerating classes of polygons that tile based on the work of the English mathematician Percy Alexander MacMahon. (Incidentally, George Andrews discussed other results due to Major MacMahon in an invited lecture given 73 years later, in 2000.) Then Wilson moved to tilings of three-dimensional space by prisms, the rhombic dodecahedron, the bees’-cell, and the tetrakaidecahedron, showing models of each and indicating their significance in nature. In the conclusion of what must have been a captivating lecture for the 60 people in attendance, Wilson discussed the work from a related problem in non-Euclidean geometry as well as Euclidean geometry. Models too accompanied this final part, this time four tetrahedra that tile Euclidean space. The question of which tetrahedra tile space is still unsolved, but there are many known families of such tetrahedra.</div>
