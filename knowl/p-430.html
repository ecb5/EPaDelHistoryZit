<div class="para">John Oxtoby served as chairman of the Philadelphia Section in 1955-1956. He had been even more active in sectional activities during the 1940s, being an invited speaker at the annual meetings three times (1940, 1943, and 1949) and serving on the Program Committee twice (1944 and 1947), chairing it in 1944. In addition he was the MAAâ€™s Hedrick Lecturer in 1956. He is perhaps best known today for his small but influential book Measure and Category: A Survey of the Analogies between Topological and Measure Space.</div>
