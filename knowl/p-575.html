<div class="para">One of Lehr’s main interests was the use of television for teaching mathematics. This was first seen when she conducted a series of television shows from October 1953 to January 1954. Titled “Invitation to mathematics,” the series was shown on Channel 6, WFIL, one of Philadelphia’s three major network stations, as part of the program called “University of the Air”. Lehr’s aim was “to show the average viewer the intention of mathematics, the mathematization drive, as a natural and power aid toward ordering our experience”. She prepared a course syllabus of abstracts and readings that the TV station circulated for twenty-five cents!
