<div class="para">Indeed in recent years, the Spring Meetings of the Association have had specialized curricular themes. I point to the periodic sessions on undergraduate student papers and the recognition given by the Section to outstanding performances in the Putnam Examination as activities consistent with the objectives of fostering undergraduate mathematics. The strength of the November meetings over the years has been to provide the members of the Section with expository papers involving advanced or research topics. History shows that contrary to what we may think, we are affected by the world around us. To make the point, the first statistical talk occurred in 1940, when S.S. Wilks of Princeton talked on statistics related to The College Boards and again in 1948 when he spoke on random sampling, statistical control, statistical tests of significance, and the like. In 1951, one finds a talk on the use of finite fields in the design of experiment by David Gosslee of North Dakota Ag. College.</div>
