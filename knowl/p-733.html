<div class="para">The meeting at Penn’s David Rittenhouse Labs the next spring, under program chair Gerald J. Porter, was the first one sponsored under the section’s new EPADEL name. The announced theme was computer graphics, with one- hour morning sessions on graphics hardware and graphics software. Next came lunch in the Egyptian Gallery of the University Museum. The two-hour afternoon session was devoted to applications of computer graphics in undergraduate mathematics education.</div>
