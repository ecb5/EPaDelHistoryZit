<div class="para">From the founding of the section in 1926 until 1962 all annual meetings were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. The resulting shift to the Saturday before Thanksgiving in 1963 caused a dramatic increase in attendance. As <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table18.html" title="Table 7.1.1: ">TableÂ 7.1.1</a> indicates, this tradition changed in 1989, when an earlier date was established. The present policy of holding annual fall meetings on the first Saturday in November has been in effect for every meeting since 1994, except for the 1996 gathering at Delaware State University.</div>
