<div class="para">Altogether 70 different lecturers account for the 80 invited talks, a number that clearly indicates a wide mix of invited speakers. It also attests to the oratorical skill of those few individuals who were invited to speak a second time. With that in mind, what can one say about the two mathematicians who were invited three times? One can say that H. O. Pollak (of Bell Labs in 1961 and 1965, and as president of the MAA in 1975) and Albert Wilansky (of Lehigh, who spoke in 7-year cycles: 1956, 1963, and 1970) not only were captivating speakers but that the mathematical topics they investigated were of interest to a large number of MAA members in the section. It was noted in <a href="Establishment.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Establishment, 1926-1932">Chapter 3</a> that Wilansky delivered the most lectures to the section, five. The six speakers who were invited twice in the present period were Frederick Cunningham (Bryn Mawr), Samuel Gulden (Lehigh), Edwin Moise (Institute for Advanced Study and Michigan), David Rosen (Swarthmore), Isaac Schoenberg (Penn), and Herbert Wilf (Penn). Recall that overall both Schoenberg and Wilf accepted four invitations to speak at the section’s annual meetings.</div>
