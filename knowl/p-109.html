<em class="alert">John Himes Pitman</em> (1890-1952) was born in Conshohocken, PA. He was awarded two degrees from Swarthmore College, an A.B. in 1910 and an M.A. in 1911. He remained at Swarthmore an additional year as a Lippincott Fellow, and then he crossed the country to become a Lick Observatory Fellow in California. In 1913 Pitman rejoined the Swarthmore community as an instructor in the department of mathematics and astronomy, and remained there the rest of his life. A mathematical astronomer who specialized in stellar parallaxes, masses of binary stars, and orbits and asteroids, he was elected president of the Rittenhouse Astronomical Society. Active politically, Pitman served as a burgess for the town of Swarthmore from 1933 to 1947 and as chairman of the county Democratic Committee. Poor health forced him to resign his professorial and political positions in 1947.</div></li></ul></div>
