<div class="para">A second measure of activity within the section is graduate education. Of the <span class="process-math">\(27\)</span> Ph.D. degrees in mathematics granted by American universities in <span class="process-math">\(1925\text{,}\)</span> universities in eastern Pennsylvania awarded four. The University of Pennsylvania awarded three: to longtime <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-66-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> secretary Harry Gehman, to Perry Aquila Caris, and to Robert William Hartley. No supervisor is listed for Caris’s dissertation, but our section founder Howard Mitchell supervised Hartley’s dissertation while section leader J. R. Kline supervised Gehman’s. The remaining Ph.D. degree was awarded to Anna M. Lehr at Bryn Mawr College. Although Marguerite Lehr officially received her degree from the physics department, the title of her dissertation indicates a purely mathematical topic: “The plane quintic with five cusps”. Besides, she was one of seven women whose doctoral studies were supervised by the renowned Charlotte Angas Scott, who taught at Bryn Mawr from <span class="process-math">\(1885\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1925\text{.}\)</span> Scott herself received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1885, although she had actually carried out her studies at Cambridge University, which did not grant degrees to women at the time. Profiles of Caris and Lehr will appear in chapters devoted to the periods in which they served as chairs of the section – Caris in <span class="process-math">\(1945\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1950\text{,}\)</span> and Lehr in <span class="process-math">\(1958\text{.}\)</span>
