<dfn class="terminology">Walter Rue Murray</dfn> (1905-1993) was born in Maryland but received his early education in New Jersey. He earned a B.S. degree from Colgate College in 1929 and then accepted an appointment at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. While teaching there he pursued graduate studies at Cornell, obtaining an M.S. in 1932. He returned to Cornell from 1938 to 1940 to continue his graduate studies, but he never earned a doctorate because his dissertation advisor, R. J. Walker, was called into government service in connection with WWII. The proposed title of his thesis was “Linear systems of plane curves”. Known as “Rue” Murray, he was appointed head of the department at F &amp; M in 1945 after serving as acting head for sixth months.  He presented an invited address to the section in 1936 and was a member of Program Committee in 1945. He stepped down as chair in 1951. Murray died in 1993 just one month shy of his 88 th birthday.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-63" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
