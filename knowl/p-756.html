<div class="para">The 1996 meeting, devoted to active learning, returned to the theme from the 1993 meeting, improving mathematics learning. President Louise Berard wrote beforehand, “Active learning at first may sound redundant because all learning IS active. However, traditional classroom techniques often allow students to be more passive than we would like regarding their educational experience.
