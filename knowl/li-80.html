</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Voris V. Latshaw</dfn> (1903-1988) was born, raised, and educated in Indiana. He received all three of his degrees from Indiana University, an A.B. in 1927, A.M. in 1928, and Ph.D. in 1930. After spending a year as acting head of the department at Fort Hays (Kansas) State College, he accepted a position at Lehigh University and spent his entire career there. During World War II he took leave to serve as a mathematician with the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics from 1944 to 1946. He was the secretary-treasurer of the Philadelphia Section during the period 1961-1967 when the MAA celebrated its 50 th anniversary (in 1965). Part of the celebration called for a history of MAA sections, a task that fell to Latshaw. His account of the first 40 years of the section appeared in the resulting book, Kenneth O. May (ed.), The Mathematical Association of America: Its First Fifty Years, MAA, 1972, pp. 94-95. Latshaw died in Delray Beach, Florida, at the age of 84.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-80" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
