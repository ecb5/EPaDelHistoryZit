<div class="para">Finally, I would comment that the Section, now known as EPADEL (the name change occurred in 1979), would not have survived without those individuals who were willing to give of their time and energy in the promotion of the section and in the organization of its many endeavors. As an aside, a catastrophe related to the 1967 Section Meeting was averted when S.S. McNeary of Drexel assumed the chair on the untimely death of E. Amelotti of Villanova. There are many others who go unnamed, but one in particular deserves mention. Professor P.A. Caris of The University of Pennsylvania served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Section from 1928 to 1941, a total of 13 years!</div>
