<div class="para">Mitchell’s publication record was not prodigious; we have been able to locate only 11 items, including his dissertation and his printed solution to a <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> problem. Between 1913 and 1918 he published seven important papers in three of the country’s leading journals: two in the American Journal of Mathematics, one in the Annals of Mathematics, and four in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Two appeared after that, an article on ideals in quadratic fields from 1926, and his final paper, which appeared in 1935 and hearkened back to his initial investigations on group theory and projective geometry. Overall, he published papers in four of the five journals that were available in America at the time.</div>
