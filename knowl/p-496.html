<div class="para">Let us review briefly the history of the position of secretary-treasurer of the section. At the organizational meeting in 1926 one of the founders, Albert Bennett (Lehigh), was elected as vice-chairman and secretary-treasurer. The next year the title “vice-chairman” was dropped when J. R. Kline (Penn) was elected secretary-treasurer. In 1928 the designation “treasurer” was dropped when P. A. Caris of Penn was elected as secretary. The secretary then resided at the University of Pennsylvania until 1947, with Perry Caris serving a record 13 years from 1928 to 1941. The present period began with G. Cuthbert Webber (Delaware) at the helm; he was elected to the post at meetings held from 1953 through 1957. As previously noted in this chapter, the by-laws were changed in 1956 to return the position of secretary-treasurer.</div>
