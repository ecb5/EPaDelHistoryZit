<div class="para">The present EPADEL Section of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-58-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> was initially called the Philadelphia Section. This name might suggest a circle as a model, with the city being the center of primary activity and radial activity emanating from it.  However, a more appropriate model is an ellipse because there were two focal points at the time of the section’s birth. One focus lay at Lehigh University, where the first idea and initial impetus originated with Joseph Reynolds and Albert Bennett. But it was soon realized that the Lehigh Valley alone did not provide sufficient support for an entire <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-59-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> section. A greater population of college mathematics teachers was needed; a critical mass was necessary. It was Philadelphia, the second focus located some <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> miles south of Lehigh, that supplied the bulk of scholars interested primarily in mathematics at the college level.</div>
