<div class="para">As might be expected, attendance at wartime meetings was lower than in other years, yet interest was sufficient to sustain the meetings every Thanksgiving. The 27 people who attended the 1944 meeting at the University of Pennsylvania was the smallest since the organizational meeting in 1926, a result of gas rationing as well as war activity by the membership, but attendance rebounded nicely to 48 the following year. Once again the low attendance at the 1950 meeting held outside the Philadelphia area at Lehigh University reflects the degree to which travel difficulties continued for MAA members. Except for the record-setting attendance at the Princeton meeting in 1954, meetings held in suburban Philadelphia drew the largest numbers, attracting slightly more members than meetings held in the city. Recall that the Philadelphia Section no longer included central Pennsylvania during the 1940s, which provides a partial explanation for the decrease in attendance figures shown in the remaining columns of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table11.html" title="Table 5.1.1: ">Table 5.1.1</a>, especially during the period 1942-1946. Overall, an average of 57 people attended meetings during this 14-year period, up somewhat from the average of 51 who attended the preceding nine meetings; 40 of the 57 belonged to the MAA, or 70% – an increase from the 60% from the previous period.</div>
