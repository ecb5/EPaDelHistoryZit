<div class="para">All four talks at the 1951 meeting are deserving of mention. Two dealt with the increasing attention being paid to mathematical pedagogy. The first speaker, R. C. Yates of the U. S. Military Academy, described various topics that stimulated interest in mathematics courses taken during the first two college years. Yates had spoken to the section in 1938 when he was at the University of Maryland. The day’s final speaker, P. J. Kiernan of the Lawrenceville School, a private secondary school located near Princeton, discussed a theme that garnered increasing interest throughout the 1950s, “Articulation of secondary and college mathematics”. In between those two talks the famous algebraist Emil Artin spoke about “Constructions with ruler and divider” and Bernard Epstein gave the first of his three talks in the decade, titled “An infinite-product expansion for analytic functions”.</div>
