<div class="para">Altogether 15 different institutions hosted the 23 meetings. This provides another indicator of a broadening of activity, and concomitant with it a broadening of the leadership base in the section. Drexel University picked up Pennâ€™s slack in the city, hosting three of the fall meetings. Swarthmore College was the site of three meetings as well. Four institutions hosted meetings on two occasions: the University of Delaware, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Haverford College, and West Chester University. The remaining nine institutions hosted one meeting each.</div>
