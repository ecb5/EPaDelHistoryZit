<div class="para">Dealing with algebra and projective geometry, Bennett’s dissertation appeared in the prestigious Annals of Mathematics the same year as his degree under the title, “An algebraic treatment of the theorem of closure”. While only 21 pages long, it accounted for over 10% of the 196 pages in that volume of the journal for the years 1914-1915. Moreover, he published a paper in three of the four issues of the next volume, all on topics in analysis. Overall his three papers and one note in the volume for 1916-1917 account for 47 of the 217 pages.</div>
