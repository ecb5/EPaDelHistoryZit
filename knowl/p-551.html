<a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a> noted that many of the lectures on applications from 1942-1955 were delivered during World War II. In the period 1956-1978, however, there was a much wider range of applications, and not one was war-related. The first, titled “Mathematical models in the biological sciences,” was given in 1971 by Willard Baxter, who played a key role in developing the excellent program in applied mathematics at the University of Delaware. Two years later A. J. Goldman, Chief of Operations Research at the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology), spoke on “Some mathematical operations research in government”. The 1976 meeting featured two talks on applications, Nelson Max, “Catastrophe theory and its applications,” and Jane Cronin, whose lecture carried the intriguing title, “Mathematical aspects of periodic catatonic schizophrenia”. The following year Steve Rohde, of General Motors Research Laboratories, drove home several points in his lecture, “Some mathematical aspects in the design of automotive components”. In 1977 Rohde received the Newkirk Award from American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his contributions to tribology (the study of friction, wear, and lubrication). We already mentioned Dorothy Bernstein’s 1978 lecture, “The role of applications in pure mathematics”. That same year Chris Rorres presented a lecture titled “The application of linear programming to the optimal harvesting of a renewable resource”.</div>
