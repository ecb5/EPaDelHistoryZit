<div class="para">We end the chapter with a mathematical classification of the lectures sponsored by the Philadelphia Section at annual meetings from 1942 to 1955. Analysis continued to be the leading choice of fields during this period, though the topology/geometry union presented a serious challenge to its dominance. The present period is also notable for the emergence of foundations as an attractive subject. However, two fields with little or no history in the section garnered even stronger interest â€“ applications and education/pedagogy.</div>
