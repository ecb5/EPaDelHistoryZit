<div class="para">During the 1930s the section sponsored talks on two emerging areas, probability and statistics, by one person, Samuel Stanley Wilks, of Princeton. The first talk was given at the 1935 meeting at Penn. Titled “Inverse probability and fiducial inference,” Wilks explained some of the difficulties that arise in attempting to apply Bayes’s Theorem on inverse probability to the problem of drawing inferences about unknown population parameters from observations, and conditions under which such difficulties can be avoided by fiducial arguments.</div>
