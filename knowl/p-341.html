<div class="para">Chapter 4 described many of the activities and dominant figures in the Philadelphia Section during the 1930s, up to the time of the U.S. entry into World War II. This chapter extends coverage to the 14-year period from 1942 through 1955, examining activities that took place during the war and the decade afterwards. The year 1956 marked a watershed in the sectionâ€™s history due to the formation of the New Jersey Section. Hence the period 1942-1955 was the last in which MAA members living in the Garden State were automatically associated with our section.</div>
