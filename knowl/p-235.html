<div class="para">Dresden began his publishing career in 1907 while a graduate student at Chicago with two papers on the calculus of variations in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>. Part of his dissertation appeared in the Transactions the following year. [14] Further advances would occur in papers that appeared in 1916, 1917, and 1923. In the latter year he also published two papers on symmetric forms in n variables. But from that time on, with only a few exceptions, all future contributions seem to appear in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>â€™s Problem or Discussions-Questions Departments.</div>
