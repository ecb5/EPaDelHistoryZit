<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Voris V. Latshaw</dfn> (1903-1988) was born, raised, and educated in Indiana. He received all three of his degrees from Indiana University, an A.B. in 1927, A.M. in 1928, and Ph.D. in 1930. After spending a year as acting head of the department at Fort Hays (Kansas) State College, he accepted a position at Lehigh University and spent his entire career there. During World War II he took leave to serve as a mathematician with the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics from 1944 to 1946. He was the secretary-treasurer of the Philadelphia Section during the period 1961-1967 when the MAA celebrated its 50 th anniversary (in 1965). Part of the celebration called for a history of MAA sections, a task that fell to Latshaw. His account of the first 40 years of the section appeared in the resulting book, Kenneth O. May (ed.), The Mathematical Association of America: Its First Fifty Years, MAA, 1972, pp. 94-95. Latshaw died in Delray Beach, Florida, at the age of 84.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Albert E. Filano</dfn> was born in Penfield, PA, in 1925. He received two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, a B.S. in 1948 and an M.A. the following year. He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics education from Penn State in 1954. Filano taught at several colleges before settling at West Chester State College in 1958. He served as chairman of the department from his appointment until 1969; from 1967 to 1969 he also was the director of the collegeâ€™s Division of Science and Mathematics. Filano then became the vice president for academic affairs, a position he held until his retirement. During his tenure he also served as acting president of the college. Filano has written several texts and workbooks, and he was the principal investigator on several NSF grants. He was awarded the Four Chaplains Legion of Honor Service Award, the Pennsylvania Council of Teachers of Mathematics Outstanding Leader Award, the Outstanding Alumnus Award from the Bennetts Valley Alumni Association, and the Outstanding Educators of America Award. Filano still resides in West Chester.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Phillip E. Bedient</dfn> was born in China in 1922. He received an A.B. from Park College in 1943 and then two degrees from the University of Michigan, an M.A. in 1946 and a Ph.D. in 1959. His doctoral dissertation was written under the well-known author of differential equations texts, Earl Rainville. Between the latter two degrees he taught at Juniata College from 1950 to 1955. He then moved to Michigan as an instructor. After receiving his doctorate Bedient accepted a position at Franklin &amp; Marshall College and remained there until his retirement in 1987. He served as chairman of the department from 1972 to 1981. He still resides in Lancaster.</div></li>
