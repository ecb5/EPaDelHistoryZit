<div class="para">One notable aspect of Pitman’s talk was his use of an emerging technology to illustrate the lecture. Rather than merely reading his paper, as was customary at the time, he used lanternslides to display photos of stars whose distances he had measured. Other speakers used lanternslides as well. Although there is no indication when speakers began using this new technology at annual meetings, lanternslides eventually gave way to overhead projectors, which are currently giving way to computer-generated presentations. There is no record of the first use of either overhead projectors or computers at the section’s annual meetings.</div>
