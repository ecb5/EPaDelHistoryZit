<div class="para">This chapter is divided into four parts. The first deals with the “pre-history” of spring meetings, as evidenced by the two special sessions in 1975. The second examines the dates, sites and themes of all spring meetings held from 1976 through 2000. The third analyzes the sites of annual meetings at combined fall and spring meetings. The final part presents a chronological account of the spring meetings from 1976 to 2000, singling out some of the individuals who played integral parts. Gerald Porter is profiled at the end of the chapter to honor his contributions to the section and the national MAA over a period exceeding 30 years.</div>
