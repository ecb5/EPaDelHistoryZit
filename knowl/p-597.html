<div class="para">The next part of the chapter describes the major sectional initiatives carried out during this period. Unlike before, the account is not based on secretaries’ reports from the Monthly because at first the reports merely listed elected officers and invited lectures, but then those reports disappeared from the Monthly altogether. Instead, the account here is mostly gleaned from files archived in the section’s records and from newsletters. Even though the range of sectional activities broadened initially, our brief chronicle provides evidence of a membership strongly committed to numerous and diverse initiatives. We describe these activities in four broad categories: students (student paper competitions, student chapters, visiting lecture series), professional development (Special Interest Groups, MAA representatives/liaisons, promotion of the cause of female mathematicians, promotion of the cause of underrepresented groups, Project NExT, a professional chapter), education (workshops, distinguished teaching award, contributed papers), and public policy (public information officers, newspaper articles).</div>
