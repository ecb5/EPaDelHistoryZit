<div class="para">The idea to form Special Interest Groups (SIGs) appeared for the first time at the annual fall meeting in 1980 when forms were distributed for members to declare their areas of special interest. By the next spring meeting Marialuisa McAllister declared, “EPADEL proudly announces the birth of its first SIG – Mathematical modeling and applications in mathematics.” At the fall meeting that year an hour was set aside for the SIGs to organize themselves. At that time Carl Leinbach of Gettysburg was appointed SIG Chairman. The newsletter for the 1982 meeting listed nine SIGs and their membership: computing and modeling, logic and foundations, mathematics anxiety, student programs, mathematics and statistics education, graduate school and job opportunity, linear programming, public policy on mathematical sciences, and the history of mathematics. Two years later Marialuisa McAllister took the reins again and distributed forms for new groups and new members. Her new list added several new groups: mathematical programming, graph theory/networks/combinatorics, student programs, and statistics. In 1986 that list expanded to include two new special interest groups: the monster simple group, and statistics/operations research. Apparently interest in SIGs dissipated quickly, because no sectional documents mention them after that time.</div>
