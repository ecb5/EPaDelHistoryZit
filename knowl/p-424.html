<div class="para">Speaking of applications of mathematics, our section never offered so many talks on this topic in its 75-year history. Their titles indicate the broad scope of the applications covered. Not surprisingly, many of these talks took place during World War II, including three of the four lectures given in 1944: G. E. Raynor (1942), “Exterior ballistics,” Peter van de Kamp (1943), “Photographic astrometry,” Marguerite Lehr (1944), “Mapping problems in aerial photography,” F. L. Dennis (1944), “Spherical triangles on a slide rule,” and F. D. Murnaghan (1944), “The uniform tension of an elastic cylinder”. The two post-war talks on applications were A. D. Hestenes (1949), “Some observations relative to mathematics in research and development organizations” and Jan Tinbergen (1953), “Mathematical techniques used in economics theory”.</div>
