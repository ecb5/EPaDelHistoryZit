<div class="para">Altogether the union of the sets of chairmen, secretaries, and members of the Program Committee supplies us with <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> different individuals who provided strong leadership throughout the seven-year period of establishment. Their academic affiliations are diverse. Four of the leaders hailed from the Lehigh Valley: Bennett, Fort, and Raynor from Lehigh and Smith from Lafayette. Three came from the Penn: Caris, Kline, and Mitchell. Moreover, the suburban Philadelphia area provided four leaders from three small colleges: Dresden and Miller from Swarthmore, Wilson from neighboring Haverford, and Clawson from Ursinus.</div>
