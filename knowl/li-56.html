He received two degrees from the University of Buffalo (B.A. 1938 and M.A.  1940) and a Ph.D. in 1942 from the University of Chicago (under A. A.  Albert). In 1942 he also married fellow graduate student Alice Turner right after the two of them had earned their degrees. R. D. Schafer was on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania from 1948 to 1953, during which time he was secretary of our section 1951-1953. His wife served on the Program Committee during the year 1952-1953. However, the Schafers left Pennsylvania in 1953 when he became head of the department at the University of Connecticut.
