<div class="para">The 15 sectional chairs embody a diverse lot. The election of I. Edward Block from Burroughs Corporation represented the first time in the section’s history that a chair carried a nonacademic affiliation. The only other chief officer to hold nonacademic employment has been Walter Stromquist. Because the section no longer included New Jersey, it was impossible for chairs to be as geographically scattered as before, but when Joerg Mayer of Lebanon Valley College was elected in 1973 and 1974 he provided leadership from the section’s northwestern region. In a similar vein, the election of Donald Western as the only chairman ever to come from Franklin &amp; Marshall College provided leadership from a similar part of the section. The University of Delaware continued its tradition of leadership when Russell Remage and Willard Baxter were elected for a total of four years.</div>
