<dfn class="terminology">Frank Leroy Manning</dfn> (1898-1986) was born in Mount Hope, New York. He received a B.S. at Cornell in 1919 after having spent the year 1917-1918 with the U.S. Naval Reserves. Later he obtained an M.S. degree in mathematics (1924) from Rutgers and a Ph.D. in statistics (1935) from Cornell. During the 1920s Manning taught high school in New Jersey for two years before becoming a principal in New York the next two years. After a two-year stint at a state teacherâ€™s college, he accepted a position at Ursinus College in 1930. He remained at Ursinus for the rest of his career except for the war years 1942-1944, when he taught extension courses in engineering science and management for the war-training program conducted by Penn State. He died in Collegeville at the age of 88.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-50" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
