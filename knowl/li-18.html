<em class="alert">Legh Wilber Reid</em> (1867-1961) was born in Alexandria, Virginia. He obtained one bachelors degree from VMI in 1887 and another from Johns Hopkins University two years later. He then worked for the U. S. Bureau of the Census and the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, where his job title was listed as “computer”. Reid was appointed an instructor at Princeton University in 1893 while he began taking graduate courses. He obtained a masters degree from Princeton in 1896, after which he sailed abroad to study in Göttingen, obtaining his doctorate under the renowned David Hilbert in 1899. Reid spent the rest of his career at Haverford College, from his appointment in 1900 to his retirement in 1934. Known affectionately to Haverford students as “<span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>”, he was one of the founders of the College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and served as its secretary for 40 years. His book The Theory of Algebraic Numbers was used as a graduate text in American colleges for over 50 years from the time it was published in 1910; David Hilbert wrote a brief introduction. Reid died in 1961 at age 93.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-9.html#li-18" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
