<div class="para">The third Princeton faculty member to speak on topology or differential geometry was one of the section’s charter members, Morris Knebelman, who had been at Lehigh University when his colleague J. B. Reynolds first broached the idea of an <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-143-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> section in 1925. Knebelman’s 1931 talk in Packard Laboratory at Lehigh came three years after he received his Princeton Ph.D. In his lecture Knebelman extended the concept of the curvature of a surface – as studied by Gauss, Rodrigues, and Riemann – to topological properties of a space. The section’s secretary, Perry A. Caris, wrote, “it is only within the last two or three years that the question of curvature has undergone a closer scrutiny.” Knebelman’s lecture considered some of the newer results. It ended up being the only lecture he ever delivered to the section, for shortly thereafter he moved to Washington State University. Although he returned to Bucknell in 1964, there is no record of any further participation in the Philadelphia Section.</div>
