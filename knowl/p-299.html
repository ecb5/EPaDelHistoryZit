<div class="para">The third, and final, invited lecture on topology was given by one of the sectionâ€™s most active members, John C. Oxtoby of Bryn Mawr College, who was elected chairman of the section in 1955. Oxtoby opened the 1940 meeting at Penn by discussing transitive flows, a topic that deals with one-parameter continuous groups of automorphisms of a topological space. As is typical of many aspects of Lie groups, this material was applied to the theory of differential equations.</div>
