<div class="para">The first coordinator of EPADEL Student Chapters was Nancy Baxter (Dickinson College), who initially found our section’s response to Anton’s call discouraging. After a few months in office she pleaded with the membership, “It’s time to organize an MAA Student Chapter at your institution! ... At this point only one school in the EPADEL section has requested application materials from the MAA office.” Baxter did not identify that school, though she suspects it was Kutztown. In a private correspondence, she wrote, “Deb Frantz was so gung- ho that I passed the torch to her. She was excited and enthusiastic. She organized the first student paper sessions and brought her students to the meetings – she set a great example for the rest of us to follow.”</div>
