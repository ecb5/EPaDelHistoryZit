<div class="para">Official records from meetings of the Philadelphia Section up to <span class="process-math">\(1954\)</span> include complete lists of all <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-137-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> members in attendance. In general we make no attempt to analyze these lists, but in this case we present a brief analysis in order to gain a greater understanding of the breadth of the mathematical community in the Philadelphia area during the roaring 20s. Then, as now, all who attended the meetings basked in camaraderie with fellow mathematics teachers. This camaraderie was more valuable at that time than today because only the University of Pennsylvania and Lehigh University contained more than a handful of mathematicians.</div>
