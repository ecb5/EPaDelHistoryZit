<div class="para">While completing his dissertation during 1915-1916, Kline was an instructor at his alma mater, Muhlenberg. After receiving his doctorate he returned to Penn, winning a Harrison Fellowship for the year 1916-1917 and accepting an instructorship for the next year. This enabled him to continue his studies with Moore. Kline left Penn in 1918, but after one year at Yale and one at the University of Illinois, he returned in 1920 to replace Moore, who had accepted a professorship at Texas. Although Moore remained at Texas and Kline at Penn for the rest of their careers, the archives at the University of Texas contain a steady stream of letters between the two, and each sent students to study under the other, either during their graduate studies or as post-doctorates.</div>
