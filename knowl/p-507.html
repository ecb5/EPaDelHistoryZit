<div class="para">The Board’s membership was composed of six national officers, a set of six governors elected at large, and a set of 14 governors elected by region. Initially two MAA members with ties to our section were elected governors at large – Arnold Dresden (Swarthmore) and the section’s founder, A. A. Bennett (Brown). The term for governors at large was three years, so two governors were elected annually.</div>
