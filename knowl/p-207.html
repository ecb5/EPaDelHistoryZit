<em class="alert">Frank Mark Weida</em> (1891-1977) was born in Allentown to Penrose John and Sarah Rebecca (Mark) Weida. He made his biggest contributions to EPADEL while a resident of nearby Bethlehem. After receiving a B.S. degree from Kenyon College in 1913 he spent the following year as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University but dropped out to become the head of the mathematics and science department at St. Albans School in Knoxville, Tennessee. That was the position he held when he became one of the charter members of the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-142-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> in 1916. In the fall of that year he returned to graduate school. However, after spending a year as a teaching assistant at the University of Chicago he left without obtaining a degree. Instead, he accepted an instructorship in mathematics at the University of Iowa while pursuing graduate studies, culminating in a Ph.D. in 1923. One year later he was appointed assistant professor at Montclair State College in New Jersey, a position he held for only one year before accepting the same position at Lehigh University. He remained at Lehigh from 1925 to 1930. During this period he was a charter member of, and an active contributor to, the Philadelphia Section.</div>
