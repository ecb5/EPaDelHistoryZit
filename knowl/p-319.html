<div class="para">Being the second speaker at the 1938 meeting, Albert W. Tucker discussed his two topology courses before the business meeting, conducted right before lunch. After the meal the audience was treated to another lecture dealing with education, but this one at the secondary level. The speaker, W. D. Carpenter, a mathematics teacher at the private Germantown Academy in Philadelphia, centered his talk about two issues. The first was the growing influence of the College Board Examinations. Carpenter felt that the inclusion of elementary calculus and analytic geometry would cause a lack of thoroughness in the other subjects taught, a theme repeated by many college teachers in the 1980s and 1990s. Next the speaker addressed criticisms of secondary mathematics, again anticipating basic issues that would arise 50 years later. He put the blame for the poor preparation of high-school teachers squarely on the shoulders of the college faculty themselves, and then he laid out a plan of improved methods in the training of future teachers.</div>
