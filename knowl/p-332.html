<div class="para">During his 28-year stint at Penn Rademacher directed 17 doctoral dissertations, more than anyone else at Penn except for J. R. Kline, who directed 19. (He directed four dissertations in Germany before emigrating.) Rademacher’s students have also played significant roles in two EPADEL institutions in Philadelphia. His 1959 graduate, Father Frederick Homann, became an institution at St. Joseph’s University. But Rademacher’s most enduring influence has been on Temple University, where his 1951 graduate, Albert Schild, initiated Temple’s Ph.D. program in 1967 and lured another Rademacher student, Emil Grosswald, from a professorship at Penn in West Philadelphia to Temple in North Philadelphia.</div>
