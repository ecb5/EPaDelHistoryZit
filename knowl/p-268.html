<div class="para">Next we discuss the composition of the section’s Program Committee (today’s Executive Committee). During the period 1933-1941 a total of 15 different individuals were elected to the Committee. Ordinarily three people served on this committee, but in 1936 there were only two; the official report from the meeting held at Lafayette does not explain this anomaly. The notation (C) in the bottom row of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table8.html" title="Table 4.2.1: ">Table 4.2.1</a> denotes the chairman, a designation that began only in 1941.</div>
