He became an assistant professor of mathematics and Latin at St. John’s College (Maryland) after earning his bachelors degree there in <span class="process-math">\(1878\text{.}\)</span> He remained in this position until receiving his masters degree two years later. From then until <span class="process-math">\(1885\)</span> he was a principal at two different schools. In the meantime he was awarded a Ph.D. from St. John’s College in <span class="process-math">\(1882\text{.}\)</span> Harter joined the faculty of Delaware College (now the University of Delaware) in <span class="process-math">\(1885\text{.}\)</span>  Initially he was a professor of mathematics and modern languages, but, after three years, physics replaced languages. In <span class="process-math">\(1896\)</span> he was chosen as President of the University of Delaware, a position he held until <span class="process-math">\(1914\text{.}\)</span> Subsequent chapters will record several other instances of Delaware mathematicians rising to top positions in the university administration.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-33" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
