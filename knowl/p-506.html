<div class="para">By 1938 many of the leaders of the national MAA had become concerned about the tenuous relationship between the MAA and its sections, so the Trustees appointed a Committee to Review the Activities of the Association. The Committee reported its findings in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> two years later. The Trustees subsequently accepted the report and discharged the committee with appreciation. Its five recommendations provided the most extensive analysis of the structure and operations of the MAA since its founding in 1915. One of those recommendations replaced the Trustees with the now familiar Board of Governors that administered and controlled all scholarly and scientific activities of the Association.</div>
