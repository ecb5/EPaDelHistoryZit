<div class="para">S. S. Wilks spoke a second time five years later, at the 1940 meeting again at the University of Pennsylvania. The title of his presentation was “Statistics involved in College Entrance Examinations”. In this invited lecture he discussed statistical problems that arise in the construction and reading of examinations, particularly those administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Wilks stressed that to secure maximum reliability in an examination with a given number of questions, care must be taken to select items of suitable difficulty satisfying the subject-matter requirements such that the correct and incorrect responses on each pair of questions are highly positively correlated.</div>
