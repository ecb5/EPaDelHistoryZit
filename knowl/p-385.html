<div class="para">By 1946 sectional meetings had returned to normal. Once again there were three lectures at the meeting. This was the first of the two years that T. A. Botts taught at the University of Delaware. He spoke on “Convex sets”. Next, Haverford’s C. B. Allendoerfer spoke on “Slope in solid analytical geometry,” the topic of a <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> paper that appeared earlier that year. Edwin Hewitt delivered the third paper, “Generalizations of the Weierstrass approximation theorem”. Hewitt was at Bryn Mawr for only one year, 1946-1947, so the Program Committee is to be commended for its perspicacious invitation. Hewitt himself received his Harvard Ph.D. under Marshall Stone.</div>
