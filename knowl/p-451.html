<div class="para">The last part of the chapter concerns the various activities sponsored by the section in the 23-year period. In addition to panel discussions, films, and student presentations, there were 80 invited lectures. We present a chronological account of the lectures and an analysis of the lectures according to their mathematical classification. Most activities were concerned with educational and curriculum issues. The highest number of invited lectures dealt with analysis and topology/geometry but substantial numbers of talks were devoted to algebra/ number theory, applications, and combinatorics/graph theory as well.</div>
