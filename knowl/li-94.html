<dfn class="terminology">David Edwin Flesner</dfn> was born in Indiana. He received his A.B. at Wittenberg University in 1966 before enrolling in the graduate program at the University of Michigan, where he obtained an A.M. (1968) and Ph.D. (1971). His dissertation – on maximal subgroups of four-dimensional symplectic groups in characteristic two – was written under Jack E. McLaughlin. Upon receiving his doctorate, Flesner came to Gettysburg College and has remained there ever since. He became chair of the department in 1999. His book Aging and the Aged: Problems, Opportunities, Challenges (edited with Edwin D. Freed) was published in 1980. For several years after that he directed an interdepartmental senior honors Seminar on Aging and the Aged. He also took part in a project at Maryland involving applications of group theory in chemistry and physics. In 2000, Flesner completed a toolbar package to implement the Klein model of hyperbolic geometry within the Cabri Geometry software.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#li-94" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
