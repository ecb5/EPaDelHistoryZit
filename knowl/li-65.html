<dfn class="terminology">Theodore Hailperin</dfn> was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1915. He received a B.S. from Michigan in 1939 and a Ph.D. four years later at Cornell for the dissertation, “A set of axioms for logic”, written under Barkley Rosser. Hailperin taught at Cornell for one year after completing his doctorate, and then he worked at the Ballistic Research Laboratory for two years. He went to Lehigh in 1946 and, apart from a year’s absence as Research Associate with Sandia Laboratory, spent the rest of his academic career there. Hailperin directed four Ph.D. dissertations on foundations between 1961 and 1975. After retirement in 1980 he was appointed adjunct professor, supervising the mathematics offerings at Lehigh’s Learning Center. He resigned from that position in 1996. He and his wife Ruth are now retired (she from Moravian) and living in Nazareth, PA.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-28.html#li-65" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
