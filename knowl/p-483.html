<div class="para">The visiting lecture program was started about 1970 by the Executive Committee, with Phillip Bedient (F&amp;M) in charge of the initial stage. He turned the program over to James Brooks (Villanova), under whom the program seemed to languish. When Bedient was elected secretary-treasurer he asked Jerry King (Lehigh) to take charge. As Brooks had discovered, it was not an easy task. However, two years later King wrote, “Some twenty members have agreed to speak at nearby schools.” A list of names and topics was mailed to all departments in the section. <a href="EPADEL.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: EPADEL, 1979-2000">Chapter 7</a> discusses the continuation of this program in the next era of the section’s history.</div>
