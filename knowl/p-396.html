<div class="para">The last meeting in this period began with a discussion by H. W. Brinkmann of work carried out under the auspices of the College Entrance Examination Board. As we saw in the preceding chapter, Brinkmann was one of the most active mathematicians in the section during the 1930s; he would speak to the section again in the 1960s! Brinkmann was followed on the program by another émigré, Hans Rademacher, who spoke on one of his favorite subjects, Dedekind sums. Two notable speakers ended the day. The renowned probabilist William Feller, yet another émigré, spoke about differential operators. In the final talk of this period NYU’s multifaceted Morris Kline spoke about material that he felt should be included in courses taught to college freshmen. Given Kline’s work in applied mathematics and his interest in the history, cultural, and pedagogical aspects of mathematics, it is not surprising that his talk carried the unusual title “Pea soup, tripe and mathematics”.</div>
