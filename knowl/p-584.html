<div class="para">Moreover, in 1995 Schattschneider was selected to present the MAA’s prestigious Hedrick Lectures. Named for the first president of the MAA, these lectures were established in 1952 to be delivered by a mathematician “of known skill as an expositor of mathematics who will present a series of at most three lectures accessible to a large fraction of those who teach college mathematics”. Only two other section officers, John Oxtoby (in 1956) and Nathan Fine (1966), have delivered Hedrick lectures. However, several of our section’s invited speakers did: Paul R. Halmos (1953), William Feller (1959), R. H. Bing (1961), Hans Rademacher (1963), George E. Andrews (1980), John Conway (1991), and Ronald Graham (1994).</div>
