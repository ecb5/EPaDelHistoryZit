<div class="para">We have seen that members of the Penn School of Analysis dominated the invited lectures in the category of <dfn class="terminology">analysis</dfn> until 1961, but Penn analysts gave only three of the 14 talks from 1956 to 1978. This trend almost reached a limit of zero in the present period, when the only talk on analysis given by someone associated with Penn was “Strange attractors and chaotic motion”, by Jerry P. Golub, who held a joint appointment in physics at Haverford and Penn in 1985. Two Temple analysts accepted invitations to speak on analysis during this period but only famed problem-solver Donald J. Newman (1985) was able to deliver his, “Addition chains when multiplications are free”. Shiferaw Berhanu (1991) was prevented by illness from presenting, “A nonlinear Fourier transform and its applications to complex vector fields”.</div>
