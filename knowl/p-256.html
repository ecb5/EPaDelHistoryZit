<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table8.html" title="Table 4.2.1: ">Table 4.2.1</a> addresses the section’s governance structure based on elections held at annual fall meetings from 1933 through 1941. Recall our convention that the year 1933 means that P. A. Caris was elected as secretary at the meeting in 1933 but carried out most of his duties during 1934. Caris continued to serve as secretary until 1941, whereupon Philip M. Whitman continued the unwritten tradition that the section’s secretary come from the University of Pennsylvania. Caris remained active in the section up to the time of his death in 1960, being elected chairman twice, in 1945 and 1950.</div>
