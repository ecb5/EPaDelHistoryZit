<div class="para">Temple was not the only institution with two faculty members lecturing on analysis. In addition to Jerry Golub, Haverford’s chair Curtis Greene presented the very first lecture in the present period, “Problems and results in unimodal sequences”. The only other talk on analysis during this period by an EPADEL member was “Real, complex, and metaphysical ideas of Karl Weierstrass” by Jerry King (Lehigh) in 1997. Some prominent members of the American mathematical community who spoke on themes from analysis during this period include Richard Anderson of LSU (1980), Paul Halmos of Santa Clara (1987), and Mary Ellen Rudin of Wisconsin (1993). Rudin is yet another prize graduate of the famous R. L. Moore School of Topology to speak to our section.</div>
