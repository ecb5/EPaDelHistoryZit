<div class="para">The time Bennett spent in World War I undoubtedly accounts for the three- year gap in his publication record between 1917 and 1920. However, like many mathematicians caught up in war, Bennett did not let combat duty entirely interfere with his studies. The author of the 1918 paper is listed as Captain Albert A. Bennett, C.A.R.C. To emphasize his position, and the isolation of his outpost, the concluding paragraph of the paper reads, “This treatment is believed to be original, but the literature available for examination by the author is that customary to an army post, ‘somewhere on the Gulf of Mexico,’ - nil.”</div>
