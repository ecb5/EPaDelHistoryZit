<dfn class="terminology">Douglas Edward Ensley</dfn> was born in Phenix City, Alabama. After earning a B.S. degree from the University of Alabama at Huntsville in 1986, Ensley moved north to enroll in the graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University. He received an M.S. degree two years later and a Ph.D. in 1993 for a dissertation on measures on categorical structures written under the supervision of Michael Albert. Upon receiving his degree, Ensley moved to Shippensburg, where he became a 1993 project NExT fellow. He served as assistant chair at Shippensburg 1995-1999. Summers found him back in Pittsburgh, however, as the mathematics instructor for the Pennsylvania Governorâ€™s School of the Sciences (PGSS) held at Carnegie Mellon. His contributions were recognized by the PGSS with an Exemplary Service Award in 1996. In addition to serving EPADEL as president and vice president, Ensley volunteered in two other capacities, coordinating the Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program 1995-1999 and directing (with Joanne Darken) Project NExT 2000-2001. In his short career Ensley has also been active with the MAA, serving as a Visiting Mathematician during the fall of 2000. This led to his being appointed editor of the MAA Digital Classroom Resources, a part of the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library. Winning a graduate student teaching award at Carnegie Mellon in 1993 foreshadowed successful teaching at Shippensburg, as three of his students have won MAA awards for student paper presentations at two different Mathfests.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#EnsleyBio" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
