</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Russell Remage, Jr.</dfn> (1915-2001) was born in West Virginia. By age 21 he had earned bachelors and masters degrees from West Virginia University, an A.B. in 1936 and an A.M. in 1937. Four years later he was commissioned in the Navy, where, at age 25, he became one of the youngest commanding officers in World War II. Following the war, Russ Remage accepted an instructorship at the University of Delaware in 1946. Over the next four years he juggled teaching duties, raising three daughters, and graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1950 for a dissertation on invariance and periodicity of transformations written under G. Schweigert. He remained on the Newark campus until his retirement in February 1981. The year 1964 was particularly propitious for Remage – he was promoted to professor, selected department chairman, and elected chair of the Philadelphia Section. He remained as chair of the section for a pair of one-year terms and chair of his department for six years. During this time he took the lead in establishing the department’s Ph.D. program. Remage and his Delaware colleague Robert Jackson served as co-editors of the SIAM’s first journal at its start in 1953. He held an NSF faculty fellowship for the year 1959-1960. An athlete throughout his life, Remage remained an avid tennis player in retirement; inspired by Tiger Woods, he took up golf at age 81. He died on May 23, 2001 at the age of 85.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-74" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
