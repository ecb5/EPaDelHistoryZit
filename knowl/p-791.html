<div class="para">The litany can go on, I would remiss if I didn’t mention some members of the section whose presentations deserve acknowledgment. Hans Rademacher of Penn talked several times. I believe that one can point to Professor Rademacher as the most famed of mathematicians of the Section. His colleague, I.J. Schoenberg, was an outstanding expositor. He presented talks on “Smoothing Operators” and “On Spline Interpolation.” In 1947, Edwin Hewitt, then of Bryn Mawr, talked on “Generalizations of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem”, while Antoni Zygmund, then of the University of Pennsylvania, lectured on “On Some Unsolved Problems in the Theory of Trigonometric Series”. He noted that the notion of function, the definite integral, and point set topology all developed in close connection with the theory of trigonometric series.</div>
