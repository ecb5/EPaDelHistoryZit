<div class="para">The game theoretic theme for 1998 was addressed by three invited lectures. Fan Chung Graham (Penn) discussed a variety of graph pebbling problems, described some classic results, and mentioned several unsolved problems in her talk titled, “Pebbling on graphs”. In the day’s opening address, Alan D. Taylor (Union College) focused on game-theoretic approaches to the question of whether honesty is the best policy in his lecture, “Strategic aspects of fair division”. The third lecture, “Puzzles and paradoxes in game theory” by Ed Packel (Lake Forest College), discussed four problems from game theory. The remaining hour was comprised of contributed papers.</div>
