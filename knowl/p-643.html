<div class="para">Another persisting tradition is that any officer of the national MAA or editor of an MAA journal becomes an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. In the present period, Doris Schattschneider served on the Executive Committee 1980-1985 for her role as editor of Mathematics Magazine and 1994-1996 as first vice president of the national MAA. Gerald Porter joined the Committee in 1989 when he was elected governor-at-large of the MAA. The next year he joined the MAA’s Finance Committee and three years later was elected treasurer of the national Association. Schattschneider was profiled in <a href="Expansion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Expansion, 1956-1978">Chapter 6</a>; Porter is profiled in <a href="SpringMeetings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Spring Meetings, 1975-2000">Chapter 8</a>.</div>
