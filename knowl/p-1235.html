<div class="para">Let me speak briefly of another thread. In 1949, H.H. Goldstine of The Institute of Advanced Study, talked on “Some Problems in Numerical Analysis” related to truncation error, and round-off error. Again in 1955, and related to the Electronic Computer Project at IAS, he spoke on “Numerical Stability” and the estimation of error. In 1961, “ALGOL 60 - A Language for Students” is promoted. By 1970, as I noted earlier, a panel discussion on how to introduce the computer into the classroom is a part of the program at an annual meeting.</div>
