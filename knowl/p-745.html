<div class="para">In his president’s message introducing the 1990 spring meeting, David Hill noted that the national MAA was about to embark on a series of new programs at the same time it looked to the past to celebrate the Association’s semisesquicentennial anniversary. He wrote, “Within EPADEL we hope to follow suit ... the spring meeting offers an opportunity for you to bring students and high school math teachers. The morning program on GEOMETRY should be especially appealing to a wide audience.” While that morning session was indeed appealing, in retrospect its introduction of the Visual Geometry Project was historic. The Project, under the direction of Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore) and Doris Schattschneider (Moravian), had been created in response to the widespread concern for the lack of 3-dimensional geometry in the schools. The former section presidents wrote, “Our multi-media approach seems of much broader applicability than our target high-school geometry population, and in particular some of our materials should be of use in a variety of college courses. In our presentation we will demonstrate some of the materials we have under development, including a videotape, some 3-dimensional models, and a computer program.”</div>
