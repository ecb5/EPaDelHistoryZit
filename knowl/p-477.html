<div class="para">An MAA Committee on the Production of Films met from 1958 to 1962, when the Committee on Educational Media superseded it. The first time a film was shown at one of our section’s meetings was 1966, when George Pólya was featured in “Let us teach guessing”. The following year “Fixed points” with Solomon Lefschetz was shown. The annual meeting in 1974 was special, however, for its screening of “Rotating polyhedral forms: M. C. Escher with a twist”. The film’s producer was, not surprisingly, Doris Schattschneider, the Escher specialist from Moravian College. No program has featured films since that time, although Robert Devaney showed a particularly impressive animated segment as part of his 1987 presentation titled “Computer graphics experiments in complex dynamical systems”.</div>
