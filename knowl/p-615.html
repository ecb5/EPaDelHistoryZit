<div class="para">In 1986 Anthony Hughes (then at Villanova) announced the initiation of a new sectional activity aimed at involving more undergraduate students in its programs. He wrote, “EPADEL is sponsoring a Student Paper Competition. Undergraduates are invited to submit papers in any area of the mathematical sciences. Winners will receive a one-year membership in the MAA.” There was no further mention of the competition until 1990, when Richard Grassl (Muhlenberg) took over. Grassl announced that the prize was raised to $100, an amount that would remain constant until 1998, when it was doubled. Six years earlier the name of the competition was changed to the Student Mathematical Papers Prize Competition, which it remains today. There have been four subsequent directors of the program: Nancy Hagelgans of Ursinus (1991), Walter Stromquist (Daniel Wagner’s) (1992-1993), and two members from Penn State – Abington: Ayoub Ayoub (1994-1997) and Lothar Redlin (1997-2000). Winners of the competition have been announced sporadically in the newsletters.</div>
