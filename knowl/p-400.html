<div class="para">A compelling reason why analysis continued to be a major attraction at sectional meetings was the existence of the internationally strong Penn School of Analysis. <a href="Emigres.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Émigrés, 1933-1941">Chapter 4</a> noted earlier contributions of Hans Rademacher, J. A. Shohat, and J. A. Clarkson. During the period 1942-1955 the section heard five talks by four new members of the Penn School, beginning with the 1945 lecture by Antoni Zygmund, “Some unsolved problems in the theory of trigonometric series”. Even though Zygmund accepted a position at the University of Chicago the next fall, the Penn School continued its tradition of keeping the section abreast of recent developments. Indeed, the object of N. J. Fine’s 1947 talk, “On Walsh functions,” was to complete a system of functions described earlier by the School’s reigning leader, Hans Rademacher. Five years before, I. J. Schoenberg gave a talk “On a theorem of Jensen” that dealt with circles in the plane and roots of polynomials but which we have classified under analysis because of a familiarity with the speaker’s work. We drew the same conclusion about Schoenberg’s 1949 paper “On smoothing operations,” even though section secretary C. O. Oakley did not provide an abstract of this talk. There can be no doubt that the two lectures delivered in 1950 and 1951 by Bernard Epstein concerned analysis, however. The first one dealt with “The classification of Schlicht functions,” a topic that concerns smooth (analytic) functions. Epstein’s second talk had a similar theme, “An infinite-product expansion for analytic functions”.</div>
