<div class="para">The program at the 1982 meeting reflected the advantage of the flexible format over the traditional fare at fall meetings. The theme was curricular interfaces, a term that was defined in the first talk of the day, when Anthony Ralston (SUNY-Buffalo) proposed replacing calculus as the first course in the standard curriculum for mathematics majors by a course in discrete mathematics. Next, James P. Crawford (Lafayette) provided a 15-minute rebuttal by raising some concerns about such a radical change. Following that came a 30-minute “Audience discussion” moderated by Carl Leinbach (Gettysburg). The final part of the morning session featured a lecture by Eugene M. Luks (Bucknell) titled, “Recent advances in graph isomorphic testing: An application of group theory in computer science”. Like the morning session, the afternoon did not adhere to the usual format of two one-hour talks. Instead, there was a “Microcomputer medley” of five 30-minute presentations on “the use of microcomputers and intelligent terminals in the teaching of undergraduate mathematics.” <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table28.html" title="Table 8.3.1: ">Table 8.3.1</a> lists the five speakers, their affiliations, and the titles of their presentations. Some presentations were conducted concurrently so the audience could view the demonstrations up close and gain hands-on experience with the materials; some were also repeated.</div>
