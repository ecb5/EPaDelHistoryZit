<div class="para">The 1997 meeting duplicated the theme of that year’s Mathematics Awareness Week – “Mathematics and the Internet”. The local highlight was Eugene Klotz’s presentation with the fetching title, “How the WWW is taking over all of mathematics and what you can do about it”. In the talk the former EPADEL president surveyed old and new developments in the study of symmetry from algebraic and geometric viewpoints. By the time of his lecture Klotz was known internationally for his role in developing the highly successful Math Forum Web site. Three other talks completed the program – Frank Wattenberg (Montana State), “Using the WWW, Netscape, and Helper applications to create a learning environment exploiting hands-on equipment, a CAS, Java, and the Internet to study mathematics across the curriculum”, David Cerone (Union College), “Mathematics on the Web: Looking back and looking forward”, and Frank Beatrous (Pittsburgh), “The use of network resources in calculus instruction”.</div>
