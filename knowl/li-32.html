<em class="alert">Edwin Schofield Crawley</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1862-1933\)</span>) attended five of the first seven meetings. Crawley is a native Philadelphian who received his bachelors degree from the University of Pennsylvania in <span class="process-math">\(1882\text{.}\)</span> He then became an instructor in the Department of Civil Engineering at Penn. In <span class="process-math">\(1885\)</span> he switched to the Department of Mathematics. Crawley was married in <span class="process-math">\(1888\)</span> and resided in the city of Philadelphia his entire life. In <span class="process-math">\(1892\)</span> he was awarded the first Ph.D. in mathematics that Penn ever granted. No dissertation supervisor is recorded for his thesis; it was common practice at the time to fashion a dissertation as a collection of published articles so there was no need to acknowledge any special guidance provided by a senior member of the department. In 1899 he was appointed to the Thomas A.  Scott professorship of mathematics. Today the Department of Mathematics at Penn dates its modern period from the appointment of E. S. Crawley as head of the department. To commemorate this date the department sponsored a celebration on October <span class="process-math">\(30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1999\text{,}\)</span> called “A Century of Math at Penn”.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-32" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
