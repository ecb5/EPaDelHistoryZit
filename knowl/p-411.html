<div class="para">Eight lectures dealt with topics in the algebra/number theory category, but only two concerned topics in algebra proper, thus continuing the limited offerings in this field. In 1951 Emil Artin lectured on “Constructions with ruler and divider,” where the divider, as opposed to a compass, was fixed and not free. The following year Russell Remage lectured on “Matrix inversion by partitioning”. The talk by Ernst Snapper in 1954, “Coordinates of algebraic varieties,” lay at the boundary of algebra and geometry.</div>
