<em class="alert">Perry Aquila Caris</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1890-1966\)</span>) is a native of Tylersville, PA. He spent a lifetime working his way up the academic ladder. Caris received two degrees from Bucknell University, a bachelors in <span class="process-math">\(1913\)</span> and a masters in <span class="process-math">\(1917\text{.}\)</span> He held an instructorship at Bucknell from <span class="process-math">\(1913\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1915\text{,}\)</span> which explains the four-year period between degrees. Besides, from <span class="process-math">\(1916\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1925\)</span> Caris taught at various high schools in the state, including West Philadelphia H. S. for boys. All the while he pursued graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1925\)</span> for a dissertation comprised of several papers he had published in the interim on the theory of numbers and analytic geometry. His doctorate was the very last one granted at Penn for a dissertation lacking a formal supervisor. That same year he accepted an assistant professorship at Penn, where he remained until retirement in 1960. Caris is the author, with E. S. Crawley, of the 1933 textbook A First Course in Calculus. In addition to writing several articles in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, he was cited for vital contributions to the Committee to Review the Activities of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-129-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> in the late 1930s. In <span class="process-math">\(1959\)</span> Penn awarded him a prize of $<span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> for “excellence in undergraduate teaching.” Caris died in <span class="process-math">\(1966\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(76\)</span> after having been a member of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-130-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> for <span class="process-math">\(43\)</span> years.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-24" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
