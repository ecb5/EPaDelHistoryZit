<div class="para">The presidents represent a diverse lot in various respects. Walter Stromquist was only the second officer in the section’s 75-year history to hold a nonacademic affiliation. (Ed Block was first, in 1957-1958.) The 10 presidents with academic affiliation came from eight different schools. Howard Anton and Bernard Kolman continued the line of six different presidents from Drexel University that began with James E. Davis in 1942. Wilkes College was the only other institution to boast two different presidents in the EPADEL period; Bing Wong and Louise Berard are the only two officers (in any capacity) ever affiliated with Wilkes in the section’s history. Nancy Hagelgans was the third president to come from Ursinus College, having been preceded by John Clawson in 1935 and Frank Manning in 1951. Two presidents were the second to come from their home institution: Kay Somers (Moravian College) was preceded by Doris Schattschneider by 20 years, while David Hill (Temple University) was preceded by Walter Lawton by 30 years. The remaining three presidents were the only ones to ever represent their institution in this office: David Flesner (Gettysburg College), Marvin Brubaker (Messiah College), and Douglas Ensley (Shippensburg University.) Contrary to the section’s earlier history, no president in the EPADEL period came from the four institutions that produced the most presidents up to 1979: the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Delaware.</div>
