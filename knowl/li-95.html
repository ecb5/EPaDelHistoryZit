<dfn class="terminology">Bernard Kolman</dfn> was born in Havana, Cuba, and became a naturalized citizen in 1953. He received all of his higher education in the U.S., earning a B.S. <i class="foreign">summa cum laude</i> from Brooklyn College in 1954 and an Sc. M. from Brown University two years later. From 1957 to 1964 he was a principal mathematician at the UNIVAC Division of Sperry Rand Corporation. Meanwhile he completed his doctoral studies at Penn, and received his Ph.D. in 1965 for a dissertation on the lattice of subalgebras of a Lie algebra written under Morikuni Goto. Kolman had accepted an assistant professorship at Drexel in 1964, and he remained there 34 years until his retirement in 1998, having served as department head 1971-1972. During that tenure he organized two well-known conferences in Lie algebras and edited the proceedings from them. He also directed one Ph.D. student. Kolman is the author of numerous textbooks that have been translated into several other languages.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#li-95" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
