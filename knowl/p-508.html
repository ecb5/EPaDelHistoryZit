<div class="para">The principal change to this organizational scheme, however, concerned the regional governors. The Committee to Review the Activities of the Association acknowledged the vital role that the MAA sections played. Their report stated, “The Sections are ... vital and active and have a conscious and definite purpose ... [yet] the inter-relation between the Sections and the Association as a central body is tenuous almost to the point of non-existence.” Hence the report recommended the creation of 14 regions, each to elect one governor for a term of two years. Region 3 consisted of four states: Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The first governor elected from the region was Frederick W. Owens, who, as we have seen, had been an active member of the section even after Penn State was formally associated with the Allegheny Section in 1933. His term ran from 1941 to 1943. Owens was succeeded by Arnold Dresden for 1943-1945. The next regional governor, L. L. Dines (Carnegie Institute of Technology), had no ties to our section. His term was 1945-1947.</div>
