<em class="alert">Cletus Odia Oakley</em> (1899-1990) was born in Texas. Today he is best known for his textbooks, especially his 1955 work Principles of Mathematics written with Carl B. Allendoerfer. After serving a one-year tour of duty with the U. S. Navy in 1918-1919 Oakley obtained three degrees in three-year increments, beginning with a bachelors from the University of Texas in 1923. After a one-year stint as an engineer with Western Electric Company, he accepted an instructorship at Brown University, where he stayed for two years, leaving in 1926 with a masters degree. He received his Ph.D. in 1929 at the University of Illinois under Robert Carmichael. Upon graduation Oakley returned to Brown to teach for another five years. He then came to Haverford College in 1934 and spent the rest of his life on the Main Line campus, serving as head of the department from 1942 until his retirement in June 1964. Of course he took several leaves during this tenure, with sabbaticals in 1947-1948, 1955-1956, and 1960-1961, and a leave of absence in 1952-1953. In addition to eight textbooks, Oakley published 14 papers (mostly on differential and integral equations) and served as associate editor of the Monthly for five years. In addition he was the chair of the mathematics committee of the College Entrance Examination Board and editor-in-chief of the mathematics section in Collierâ€™s Encyclopedia. Oakley was also known as an excellent lecturer who was supported by the NSF to address teachers in states along the Atlantic seaboard. At Haverford, however, he was best known among students for his athletic prowess, especially in handball; a standing offer held that any student who beat him was guaranteed an A in his class. He defeated all comers into his late sixties. Upon retirement Oakley spent two years on a Fulbright grant, his fourth, working with teachers in Australia. He died at age 91 in Ann Arbor, where he lived with his son, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-21.html#li-40" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
