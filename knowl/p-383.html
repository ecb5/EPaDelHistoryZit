<div class="para">Interestingly, the 1944 meeting of the Philadelphia Section did not reflect the ongoing war. Even Marguerite Lehr’s talk, “Mapping problems in aerial photography,” dealt with a method employed by the Canadian Topographical Survey and not with a theme that the title might otherwise suggest. The only vestige of World War II at the 1945 meeting was that D. H. Lehmer’s affiliation was listed as Aberdeen. However, the title of his talk was “Some graphical methods in the theory of numbers”.</div>
