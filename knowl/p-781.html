<div class="para">On November 27, 1926, the Philadelphia Section was born. It was the thirteenth section and the second Eastern section of the MAA (The Maryland- D.C.-Virginia Section already existing). It is reported that Cairns and Slaught, national officers and from the Midwest, expressed concern about the “seeming apathy or lethargy” of the mathematicians of the Atlantic States. The Philadelphia Section was to attract members from Eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. The name (Philadelphia Section) caused a great deal of concern since all other sections had names of states, and to choose the name of a city broke all tradition. The Section countered. Pennsylvania had two population centers and by forming a section in the eastern portion of the state, one might prompt the forming of a Pittsburgh Section. The name was finally granted. The section was admitted subject to the conditions of the By-Laws and promises of good behavior. In 1926, there were 7 members of the MAA listed for Delaware, and 105 individuals listed in Pennsylvania (not all members of the Section). At the first meeting, held at Lehigh, there were 20 individuals present. Present were individuals from F and M, Haverford, Lafayette, Lehigh, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton. The first chair of the section was H.H. Mitchell of the University of Pennsylvania, while A.A. Bennett of Princeton served as the first Secretary-Treasurer. It is noted that among the speakers at this first meeting was J.A. Foberg, the State (PA) Director of mathematical Instruction, who noted the attention given the secondary School curricula by MAA, the fact that mathematics was only required during the first nine-years of schooling and the fact that some universities and colleges were demanding 12 units of senior high mathematics. He called for a study to advise on appropriate curricula in the secondary school.</div>
