<div class="para">James A. Shohat (show-hot) was one of several émigrés to settle in the Philadelphia area. Born in Brest-Litovsk, Russia, on November 18, 1886, he earned two degrees from the University of Petrograd (now St. Petersburg). The first, an equivalent of our bachelors degree, was awarded in 1910. Shohat was a Fellow there from 1912 to 1916, and from 1913 to 1917 he was an instructor at the Polytechnic Institute of Petrograd. The next year he was an instructor at the Mining Institute of Petrograd. Then he accepted a professorship at Ural University in Ekatherineburg, where he remained until 1921, when he returned to Petrograd as a professor at the Pedagogical Institute. He was awarded the degree of Magister of Pure Mathematics, the equivalent of our Ph.D., in 1922.</div>
