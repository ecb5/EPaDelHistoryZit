<div class="para">The only other institution that was the site for more than one meeting in the 22-year period is the University of Delaware, which hosted meetings in 1980 and 1990. This makes five times in the history of the section that an annual fall meeting was held in Newark. The 1990 meeting was historic; over lunch, Willard Baxter presented a short history of the section. Besides, the day began with a welcome by university president, and former mathematics professor, David P. Roselle, yet another instance of Delaware mathematicians holding top administrative positions. Recall from <a href="Establishment.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Establishment, 1926-1932">ChapterÂ 3</a> that G. A. Harter, Delaware president 1896-1914, was an active member of the section from its inception in 1926.</div>
