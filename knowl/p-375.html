<div class="para">The Philadelphia Section sponsored 56 presentations involving 58 speakers at the 14 annual meetings held from 1942 to 1955. The 1954 meeting included a discussion by three people that accounts for the disparity in the two numbers. After discussing the presenters and their affiliations, we take a chronological tour of the meetings to analyze sectional activity from this perspective, after which we discuss the lectures in terms of mathematical classification. Unlike previous chapters, however, we do not list a separate table of the presentations. The interested reader is referred to the appendix for the complete list in this period.</div>
