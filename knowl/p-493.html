<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Isaac Edward Block</dfn> is a native Philadelphian who was born in 1924. He received his bachelors degree in physics from Haverford College in 1944. He then obtained two degrees from Harvard, an M.S. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1952, both in mathematics with the latter under the famous analyst Joseph Walsh. Ed Block was a mathematics consultant for Philco Corporation from 1951 to 1954. During this time he was a founder of SIAM; he was elected its first secretary and served as managing editor of its first journal. Subsequently, as a volunteer, he served as chair of the SIAM’s publications committee, and eventually as chair of the SIAM board. In 1954 Block accepted a position with the computer company Burroughs Corporation as manager of its Philadelphia Computer Center. He was employed there when elected chair of the Philadelphia Section three years later. Block later worked at another computer company, Remington Rand Univac - Philadelphia, as manager of its applied mathematics department. Later he became a vice-president of Auerbach Publishers, Inc. In 1976 he was persuaded to become SIAM’s first full-time managing director, a position he held until his retirement in 1994. That same year Block was awarded the MAA’s Certificate of Merit, the only person from our section to receive it during the section’s first 75 years. The Certificate of Merit is a special award given at irregular intervals for some special work or service associated with mathematics or the wider mathematical community. Block still resides in the Philadelphia area.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Walter S. Lawton</dfn> was born in 1906 in Mt. Carmel, PA. He received his A.B. degree from Temple University in 1929, and then obtained two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania: an M.A. in 1930 and a Ph.D. in 1934 (for a dissertation written under former section chair J. A. Shohat). Lawton spent his entire professional career at Temple, from his hiring in 1930 until his retirement 40 years later. He served as chair of the department from 1954 to 1970. During World War II he served his country in the U. S. Naval Reserves from 1942 to 1945. He was nominated as chairman of the section’s Committee on High School Contests in 1957 and was elected chair of the section two years later. The section newsletter reported Temple’s initiation of Lawton Lectureships in 1976 to honor his contributions to the University. It was cryptically recorded there that “Lawton disappeared about six years ago at his summer home in the Poconos.” He was pronounced dead officially in February 1971.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology"></dfn> (1913-1996) is a native Philadelphian who spent most of his life in the area. He received a B.S. from Haverford College in 1936 and an M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania seven years later. Sam McNeary was an instructor at the Drexel Institute of Technology from 1939 until his retirement 1978, except for three years during World War II. He introduced Drexel’s first courses in statistics and numerical analysis. During the war, from 1943 to 1946, he worked as a design engineer on defense-related projects at Westinghouse Corporation in Philadelphia. McNeary was a member of the founding group of SIAM in 1951. He was Drexel’s representative to SIAM, and he served for several years as an editor of the SIAM Newsletter and the SIAM Review. He was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1960. He also agreed to assume the chairmanship in 1968 when Emil Amelotti passed away midway through his second one-year term. McNeary was the author of a calculus text and several papers on hydraulics and other engineering projects. After retirement he became interested in home renovations and bought, refurbished, and sold a dozen houses. McNeary died after suffering a stroke in suburban Philadelphia three months shy of his <span class="process-math">\(83\)</span>rd birthday.</div></li>

<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Russell Remage, Jr.</dfn> (1915-2001) was born in West Virginia. By age 21 he had earned bachelors and masters degrees from West Virginia University, an A.B. in 1936 and an A.M. in 1937. Four years later he was commissioned in the Navy, where, at age 25, he became one of the youngest commanding officers in World War II. Following the war, Russ Remage accepted an instructorship at the University of Delaware in 1946. Over the next four years he juggled teaching duties, raising three daughters, and graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, resulting in a Ph.D. in 1950 for a dissertation on invariance and periodicity of transformations written under G. Schweigert. He remained on the Newark campus until his retirement in February 1981. The year 1964 was particularly propitious for Remage – he was promoted to professor, selected department chairman, and elected chair of the Philadelphia Section. He remained as chair of the section for a pair of one-year terms and chair of his department for six years. During this time he took the lead in establishing the department’s Ph.D. program. Remage and his Delaware colleague Robert Jackson served as co-editors of the SIAM’s first journal at its start in 1953. He held an NSF faculty fellowship for the year 1959-1960. An athlete throughout his life, Remage remained an avid tennis player in retirement; inspired by Tiger Woods, he took up golf at age 81. He died on May 23, 2001 at the age of 85.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Emil Amelotti</dfn> (1904-1968) was born April 10, 1904, in Italy. He received two degrees from the University of Illinois, a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1926 and an M.S. in mathematics in 1928. Although he did graduate work for one year at the Politechnico Institute (Turin, 1931-1932) and five years at the University of Chicago (1933-1938), he did not receive a doctorate. Amelotti came to Villanova in 1938 and remained there until his untimelyEXPANSION, 1956-1978 Page 113 death on March 3, 1968, one month shy of his 64 th birthday. Amelotti was the first chair of the mathematics department at Villanova when it was founded in 1947. Five years later he was elected SIAM’s first treasurer. He was also elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1966 and 1967 but died midway through his second term. Amelotti was an MAA member for nine years.</div></li>
<li><div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Hugh Norton Albright</dfn> was born in Jerusalem in 1928. He received a bachelors degree from Catholic University (Washington, DC) and two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. A Christian Brother, he received his Ph.D. in 1959 for a dissertation written under Morikuni Goto titled, “Compact complex homogeneous manifolds.” Brother Albright has taught at LaSalle his whole career – a total of 44 years! – from his arrival in January 1951 until retirement in 1995. He was chairman of the mathematics department from 1964 to 1970. He was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1970 and 1971 after having served as vice-chair for two years.
