<div class="para">In 1945, the concern was expressed that teachers are leaving the classroom for better jobs. The speaker expressed the need to mobilize a retraining program for secondary teachers. By 1955, we find H. Brinkmann of Swarthmore College reporting on the integration of high school and college mathematics (Admission with Advanced Placement) and in 1959, J. Brown of Delaware chairing a committee to act as liaison with state authorities on the curricula. That same year, V. Haag of F and M reported on SMSG. Thus, throughout its history, the section has undertaken to work cooperatively with teachers and administrators of pre- college mathematics.</div>
