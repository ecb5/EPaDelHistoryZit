<div class="para">The first public notice of the Executive Committee’s express interest in sponsoring a second meeting each year occurred in the section’s February 1976 newsletter. An item titled “Special spring meeting” announced, “Plans are brewing for a special session on the use of mathematical models in undergraduate teaching Saturday, April 10, at Gettysburg College. Carl Leinbach (Gettysburg) is chairman of the planning committee. Other members are Jerry Porter (Penn) and Eugene Klotz (Swarthmore.) Professor Leinbach is willing to organize some special entertainment for families of members. If enough interest is shown, he will plan a bus tour of the battlefield conducted by a member of the Gettysburg College History Department.” Although those plans did not materialize exactly, the idea of holding a spring meeting in addition to the annual fall meeting got off to a good start.</div>
