<div class="para">Before moving from secretary-treasurers to members of the Program Committee, we pause to introduce <dfn class="terminology">Alice T. Schafer</dfn>, wife of R. D. Schafer and an outstanding mathematician in her own right. Alice Schafer was one of the founding members of the Association for Women in Mathematics in 1971 and its president from 1973 to 1975. In 1990 the Association for Women in Mathematics established the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize to honor her for her many years of unselfish and dedicated service towards increasing the participation of women in mathematics. The prize is awarded every year to an undergraduate woman in recognition of excellence in mathematics courses and special programs. Two undergraduate students from the EPADEL area were recognized for their mathematics excellence in 1992, with Zvezdelina E. Stankova of Bryn Mawr winning the third Schafer Prize and Eug√©nie Hunsicker of Haverford receiving honorable mention. In 1999 Laura Ciobanu of Franklin &amp; Marshall earned honorable mention.</div>
