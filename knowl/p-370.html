<div class="para">Next we discuss the section’s Program Committee, whose membership is listed in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table12.html" title="Table 5.2.1: ">Table 5.2.1</a>. Recall that (C) denotes the chairman of the committee. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table12.html" title="Table 5.2.1: ">Table 5.2.1</a> lists the three people who served on this committee in every year except 1942, when the members were omitted in the official report. Recall that in 1953 this committee became part of an enlarged Executive Committee. Although membership on the Program Committee was no longer specified after 1954, we included the 1955 membership of three people who were listed merely as “committee members” in the report from the 1955 meeting.</div>
