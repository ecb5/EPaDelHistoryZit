<div class="para">All data here refer to annual fall meetings. The section began to sponsor annual spring meetings in 1976 but we consider them separately in the next chapter. Also, the Community College of Philadelphia hosted a meeting in October 1990 but it was a special meeting, not the annual meeting. CCP thus became the second community college to host a meeting sponsored by the section.</div>
