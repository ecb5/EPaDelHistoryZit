<div class="para">During the EPADEL period the four individuals who served as secretary- treasurer of the section continued the long tradition of lengthy, dedicated service. Altogether, 17 different people have been elected secretary-treasurer in the 75- year history of the section. However, three of them served only one year, meaning that the remaining 14 secretary-treasurers served a total of 72 years in office. We have already met two of the four secretary-treasurers who served in the EPADEL period â€“ Will Baxter and Kay Somers. The latter was the only female to hold this position in the 75-year history of the section.</div>
