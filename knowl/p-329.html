<div class="para">In the fall of 1934 Rademacher immigrated to the University of Pennsylvania as a visiting professor under a joint grant from the Emergency Committee of Displaced German Scholars and the Rockefeller Foundation. The head of Penn’s graduate program in mathematics at the time, J. R. Kline, certainly knew the visitor’s worth. In 1936 Kline convinced Penn authorities to offer Rademacher an assistant professorship and tenure. Rademacher accepted, and he ultimately stayed at Penn until retirement in 1962, having been promoted to full professor in 1939.</div>
