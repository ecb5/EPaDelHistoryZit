<div class="para">The dozen chairmen represent a diverse lot in several ways. Geographically scattered, they span the section from the University of Delaware in the west to Rutgers in the east. The most notable change that occurred during this period was the emergence of MAA members from Delaware into positions of sectional leadership. Until this time the only faculty member from Delaware to participate in any functions sponsored by the section was G. A. Harter. The first official elected to office from the state of Delaware was C. J. Rees in 1946. His colleague G. Cuthbert Webber followed three years later. We profile Webber at the end of the chapter to honor his many contributions to the section during this period.</div>
