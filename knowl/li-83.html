After attending public schools in the city, she entered Bryn Mawr College in 1936 at the height of the depression. A scholarship enabled her to live on campus during her final two years. Wurster remained at Bryn Mawr as a graduate assistant 1941-1943, taking all her courses from three other sectional leaders â€“ Anna Pell Wheeler, Marguerite Lehr, and John Oxtoby. Then she accepted a fellowship to the University of Chicago. During her three years in the Windy City she was very active with the Junior Mathematical Club, serving on the Executive Committee and presenting a paper on Fourier coefficients her first year, being elected social chair the second year, and elected chair the final year. She also completed her dissertation (under Lawrence Graves) in 1946 on the calculus of variations.
