<div class="para">The 1999 meeting at Villanova was cosponsored by the Middle Atlantic Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications Throughout the Curriculum (MACMATC), so the day’s theme – mathematical applications throughout the curriculum – is not surprising. The morning session offered 11 workshops, four of which were offered by key members of our section: Annalisa Crannell (F &amp; M), “The mathematics behind depth in drawings”; Joanne Darken (CCP), “Precalculus in the here and now: Payoffs the same semester”; Linda Thiel (Ursinus), “Life’s a risk!”; Dennis DeTurck and Larry Gladney (Penn), “Moments of inertia – Integrated first-year calculus and physics”.
