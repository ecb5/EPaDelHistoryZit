There are several ways in which this meeting differed from all others. For instance, three of the five speakers were associated with institutions in the Lehigh Valley, two from Lehigh University. One of them, Joseph Reynolds, was given the opportunity to be the section’s very first speaker in honor of his role in founding the section. The second speaker was Howard Mitchell, another founder. Leroy Smail and Will Smith were the other two speakers from the Lehigh Valley, with Smail from Lehigh and Smith from Lafayette. Mitchell hailed from Penn.</div>
