<div class="para">Four other members who lived within the Philadelphia Section’s boundaries are also worthy of mention. W. F. Long of Franklin &amp; Marshall College traveled from Lancaster, H. S. Everett from Penn State, C. J. Rees from the University of Delaware in Newark, and Ruth Thompson from the New Jersey College for Women at Rutgers. Neither Long nor Everett participated in many sectional activities, but Rees was elected chair in 1946 and Thompson organized the section’s annual meeting in 1934. We have been unable to find any biographical information on Ruth Thompson. William F. Long and Carl J. Rees will be introduced later, but for now we supply information on H. S. Everett.</div>
