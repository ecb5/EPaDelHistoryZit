<div class="para">Forced retirement from Penn at age 70 did not mean the end of mathematical activity for the indefatigable Rademacher. He joined several other notable immigrants as a visiting professor at the Courant Institute in New York 1962- 1964, after which he moved to the Rockefeller University as a visiting professor 1964-1966 and an affiliate from 1966 until his death three years later. The University of Pennsylvania memorialized Rademacherâ€™s name with a prestigious lecture series that began in 1978 with talks by Marcel Schutzenberger, I. M. Singer, and John Tate, and has numbered several Fields Medallists since then.</div>
