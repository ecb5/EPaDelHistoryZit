<em class="alert">Echo Dolores Pepper</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1897-1979\)</span>) was born, raised, and mostly educated in the Pacific Northwest. We do not know the origin of her most unusual first name. Hailing from Spokane, Washington, Echo Pepper received her B.S. degree in 1920 and her M.S. two years later from the University of Washington in Seattle. She entered the graduate program at the University of Chicago in <span class="process-math">\(1923\)</span> and obtained her Ph.D. two years later under the eminent algebraist Leonard Dickson. After spending a year at Oxford University on a National Research Council fellowship, Pepper accepted an instructorship in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, a position she held for only two years.
