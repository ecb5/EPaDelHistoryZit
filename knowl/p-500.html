<div class="para">The Program Committee evolved into the Executive Committee in 1956 and expanded 12 years later. From that time onward, the committee was composed of six at-large members, each serving a three-year term, with two new members elected every year. It became customary to fill the three new slots that were added to the committee in 1968 with members associated with a two-year institution, a high school, and a nonacademic employer.</div>
