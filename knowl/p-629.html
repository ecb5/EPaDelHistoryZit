<div class="para">The year 1990 was a banner year for sectional activities aimed at increasing minority representation in mathematics. First a lunch table was set-aside at the annual spring meeting “for anyone who would like to discuss ways of drawing more minority students into mathematics.” This gathering generated a special EPADEL meeting held under the leadership of Joanne Darken at Community College of Philadelphia on October 13. Titled “Underrepresented groups in mathematics: Overcoming the obstacles”, the program began with a morning session featuring two stellar speakers, Johnny Houston and Uri Treisman. The afternoon session consisted of two one-hour panel discussions, “Filters in the pipeline”, moderated by Joan Countryman (Germantown Friends School), and “Pumps in the pipeline”, moderated by Marvin Brubaker (Messiah College). The meeting’s success generated interest at the national MAA meeting the next year, as reflected by an article in the Association’s journal Focus. EPADEL then sponsored a workshop conducted by Uri Treisman at Swarthmore on October 27, 1991, on programs designed to improve minority participation and performance in college-level mathematics courses.</div>
