<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table23.html" title="Table 7.4.1: ">Table 7.4.1</a> lists all EPADEL members who presented invited lectures in this period, by institution. We comment on a few of the institutional affiliations. William Dunham’s talks in 1992 and 1999 mark the only time in the section’s history that a faculty member from Muhlenberg delivered an invited lecture. Similarly, talks by Paul Wolfson (1987), Kenneth A. Brakke (1993), and James P. Fink (1994) represent the only times that speakers have ever come from West Chester, Susquehanna, or Gettysburg, respectively. Although Gary Gordon was the sixth faculty member from Lafayette to give an invited lecture, his 1996 talk was the first since 1941; James Crawford kept the Lafayette tradition alive in 1999.</div>
