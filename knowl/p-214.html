<div class="para">The section certainly provided the opportunity for mathematicians in the area to keep abreast of progress in differential geometry and topology. With Princeton housing arguably the most prominent set of topologists in the world, it is no wonder that the section would consider the latest developments. James Alexander delivered the first such talk at the section’s third meeting, held at Penn in 1928 in front of a record crowd of 75 people. (That record lasted until the 1954 meeting at Princeton, when 115 attended.) Simply titled “Knots,” his address examined the unsolved problem of finding sufficient invariants to determine completely the knot type of an arbitrary simple closed curve in three-dimensional space. This topic has a modern ring to it even now.</div>
