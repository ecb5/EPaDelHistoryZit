<div class="para">There were several short-lived attempts to establish mathematical journals throughout the <span class="process-math">\(19\)</span>th century, including the <span class="booktitle">Mathematical Correspondent</span> and three different periodicals called <span class="booktitle">The Analyst</span>. The first to find a permanent niche on American soil was the <span class="booktitle">American Journal of Mathematics</span>, founded at Johns Hopkins University in 1878 by J. J. Sylvester and William Story. Six years later a second such journal was initiated by Ormond Stone at the University of Virginia, the <em class="emphasis">Annals of Mathematics</em>.</div>
