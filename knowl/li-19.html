<em class="alert">Harry Scheidy Everett</em> was born in Scheidys, PA. He taught in high school from the time of his graduation in 1908 until 1915. In the meantime he attended classes at Bucknell, where he obtained three degrees in consecutive years – A.B. 1912, A.M. 1913, Sc.M. 1914. He accepted an instructorship at Bucknell in 1915. H. S. Everett spent the year 1921-1922 on a fellowship at the University of Chicago, resulting in his Ph.D. at the end of the year. His dissertation topic involved homogeneous polynomials expressible in terms of determinants whose elements were such polynomials. Upon returning to Bucknell he was promoted to professor of applied mathematics and astronomy. However, in 1927 he returned to Chicago, where he held several positions over the next 29 years – professor of extension courses, professor of home study, dean, and lecturer in the Adler Planetarium. From 1926 to 1933 he served as an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>. Upon retirement in 1956 as Extension Professor Emeritus, Everett accepted a visiting professorship at Penn State. Five years later he returned to academia full time when he accepted a professorship at East Stroudsburg. Everett moved to West Chester in 1973, and he died there four years later at age 86.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-9.html#li-19" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
