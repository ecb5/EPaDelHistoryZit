<div class="para">The other lecture was by Penn State’s Helen B. Owens, whose title was “Mathematics clubs, old and new”. We have already discussed Helen and her husband, Frederick, during the time Penn State was aligned with the Philadelphia Section, and even after the formation of the Allegheny Section in 1933. Here Owens suggested various activities that could be used to stimulate interest in mathematics among undergraduate students, including the use of problem contests, joint club meetings, mathematical exhibits (like the one described by Albert Wheeler above), public lectures, and student mathematical publications. The section’s Deborah A. Frantz, the indefatigable Kutztown University professor who served as EPADEL’s Student Chapter Coordinator throughout the 1990s, carried out every one of these activities in that decade.</div>
