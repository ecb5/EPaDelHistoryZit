<div class="para">In <a href="Founding.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Founding">Chapter 2</a> we pointed out that the 1925 dissertation of Bryn Mawr’s Marguerite Lehr dealt with algebraic geometry. Her 1931 talk at Swarthmore College, titled “On curves with assigned singularities,” evokes a common theme. In it Lehr presented her solution to the following problem: given a set of nonnegative integers satisfying a plane algebraic curve defined by Plücker equations, does a plane algebraic curve exist having these equations as its Plücker characteristic? Given the content of Smith’s talk the year before, it was appropriate for Lehr to make use of a theorem due to the famous Russian born, Italian educated, geometer Oscar Zariski.</div>
