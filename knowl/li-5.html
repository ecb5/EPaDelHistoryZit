When he was playing gigs with a band, he would put his physics books on the music stand and study while plucking away subconsciously at the instrument. Five years later he was appointed an instructor at South Dakota College (now the University of South Dakota).

Upon graduation Lamson accepted an assistant professorship at Columbia University, where he remained through the summer of <span class="process-math">\(1926\text{.}\)</span> He then moved to Lehigh University, which brought him to the area the same fall that the Philadelphia Section was founded. Three years later he presented an invited lecture at the section’s annual meeting. Lamson spent the rest of his career at Lehigh, retiring in <span class="process-math">\(1951\)</span> as emeritus associate professor. He then taught in Puerto Rico for three years before returning to teach part-time at Lehigh.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-6.html#li-5" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
