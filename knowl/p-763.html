<div class="para">Jerry Porter’s introduction to the MAA was pure serendipity. It occurred when David Rosen asked him to teach a seminar on algebraic topology at Swarthmore. That is how the two EPADEL stalwarts got to know each other. Rosen was the MAA governor at the time and he nominated Porter for the section’s Executive Committee. The rest is, as they say, “history”. In looking back over his 30 years of service to the MAA, Porter remarked, “I have a quote from Kundera on my wall that says, ‘An individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence ... into a motif, which then assumes a permanent position in the composition of the individual’s life.’ (The Unbearable Lightness of Being) That pretty much describes my MAA experience.”</div>
