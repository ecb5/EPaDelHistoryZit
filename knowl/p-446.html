<div class="para">The New Jersey Section was founded as the 27th section of the MAA in 1956 under the direction of Dean Albert Meder of Rutgers and Albert W. Tucker of Princeton, heretofore influential members of the Philadelphia Section. From that time onward, all MAA members who lived in the Garden State were affiliated with the New Jersey Section. This chapter traces developments in the Philadelphia Section from 1956 through 1978. It shows that the section continued to prosper in spite of losing a previously vital element. Indeed, the section expanded rapidly; its annual meetings attracted record crowds and the increasingly broad interests of the membership sparked the inauguration of annual spring meetings in addition to annual fall meetings.</div>
