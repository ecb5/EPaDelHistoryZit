<div class="para">The <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> for <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> also records vigorous activity by undergraduate students in the area. During its summer term the University of Pennsylvania not only offered standard courses in solid geometry, trigonometry, college algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus, but there was sufficient demand to run three advanced undergraduate courses: elementary statistics with J. D. Eshelman, advanced calculus with G. H. Hallett, and the theory of invariants with O. E. Glenn. Hallett and Glenn had received their doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania. George Hervay Hallett was awarded his degree in 1896 for a dissertation on linear differential equations. He directed the 1905 dissertation of O. E. Glenn. Hallettâ€™s son, George H. Hallett, Jr., wrote a dissertation in <span class="process-math">\(1918\)</span> under the renowned R. L. Moore at Penn.</div>
