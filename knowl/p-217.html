<div class="para">In addition to the Princeton trio, Penn’s J. R. Kline lectured on a topic that straddles topology and differential geometry at the 1932 meeting at Swarthmore College. This was the only time that Kline spoke before the Philadelphia Section. It is not entirely unexpected that a student of R. L. Moore would subject the foundations of a subject to a painstaking analysis. With this in mind, Kline analyzed various definitions of a curve, noting shortcomings of earlier attempts to define the concept. During his lecture he mentioned the work of two of his own students, Leo Zippin and Norman Rutt. (The official report from the meeting incorrectly lists Rutt’s surname as Ruth.) Kline ended his lecture by showing interrelations among three types of curves: regular, perfect continuous, and those that are the sum of a countable number of arcs.</div>
