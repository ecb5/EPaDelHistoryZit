<div class="para">Ursinus College hosted three spring meetings, the most of any institution in the section. The fall meetings held there in 1938 and 1961 occurred a long time before spring meetings were inaugurated. Four institutions hosted two spring meetings â€“ Messiah, Millersville, Penn, and Villanova. Millersville and Villanova were also the sites for two fall meetings during this period, and Penn one, but the section never met at Messiah in the fall.</div>
