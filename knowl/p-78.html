However, the official report from the most important event in the section’s history, the organizational meeting held on Saturday, November <span class="process-math">\(27\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1926\text{,}\)</span> just two days after Thanksgiving, contains details of the proceedings and so provides clues to the identity of the signatories. On that date Howard H. Mitchell of the University of Pennsylvania, and Albert A.  Bennett and Joseph B. Reynolds of Lehigh University, arranged a program of talks appropriate for college mathematics teachers at Lehigh. In so doing, these three mathematicians became the founding members of the section. Their profiles are given at the end of the chapter and their continued participation in sectional activities is chronicled in subsequent chapters.</div>
