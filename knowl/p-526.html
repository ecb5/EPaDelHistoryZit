<div class="para">V. V. Latshaw’s report from the 1965 meeting reads, “At the business meeting R. L. Wilder read the names of six charter members of MAA now affiliated with the Philadelphia Section.” However, the report does not list the six names. An examination of the MAA’s list of charter members has turned up four who lived within the section’s boundaries in 1965. Two resided in the area when they joined the MAA in 1915 – Joseph B. Reynolds and William M. Smith. In addition, George E. Raynor lived in the state of Washington, while Anna Pell (later Anna Pell Wheeler) lived in Massachusetts.</div>
