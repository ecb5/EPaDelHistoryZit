<div class="para">In 1953 C. O. Oakley presented a talk titled “A new approach to freshman mathematics” in which the master expositor reported on an ambitious freshman course developed over the previous seven years at Haverford College. How ambitious? The syllabus included topics in logic, groups, the number system, fields, functions, analytic geometry, calculus of polynomials, probability and statistics. Two more lectures on educational themes were delivered at the final meeting of the present period, held at Bryn Mawr College in 1955. H. W. Brinkmann began the day’s program with “A report on the Ford Foundation study on the integration of high school and college mathematics”. In this lecture Brinkmann summarized the results of mathematics examinations administered that spring by the Conference of Mathematics Teachers in coordination with the College Entrance Examination Board. As noted above, in the final lecture of the day Morris Kline strongly recommended that in all freshman courses, “mathematics be tied intimately to physical problems and to its cultural setting and significance”.</div>
