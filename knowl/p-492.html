<div class="para">Lehr, Schattschneider, and Wilansky are profiled at the end of the chapter. For now we provide biographical sketches of the 12 remaining chairs in the order of their terms. The position of vice-chairman was created in 1968 when LaSalle’s Hugh Albright was the first person elected to the position. Without express mention, the title of the position was changed to vice-chairperson when Doris Schattschneider was elected in 1975. Correspondingly Gene Klotz was referred to as the chairperson. Since every vice-chair became the next chair, there is no need to present separate sketches of the vice-chairs. A biographical sketch of the final vice-chair in this period, Howard Anton, appears in the next chapter. (Several section leaders were involved in the founding and the establishment of SIAM – the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics – which has had its headquarters in Philadelphia since it was conceived in the fall of 1951.)</div>
