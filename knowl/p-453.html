<div class="para">Columns 3, 4, and 5 in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table13.html" title="Table 6.1.1: ">Table 6.1.1</a> list those attendance figures we were able to locate. Although the secretaries’ annual reports listed total attendance (#) and the number of attendees who belonged to the MAA, they no longer listed the names of MAA members. One salient feature is the dramatic increase in attendance beginning with the 1963 meeting. The doubling of local attendance was evident at meetings held at Lehigh Valley colleges in 1971 and 1977 too, unlike earlier periods when travel difficulties caused relatively low attendance at meetings held there. What might explain this extraordinary increase? A reason might be found by examining MAA membership levels, but those numbers show only a gradual increase from 10,000 in 1960 to 12,800 in 1962, 14,000 in 1963, and 15,600 in 1964.</div>
