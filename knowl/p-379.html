<div class="para">Now we take a chronological tour of annual meetings from 1942 to 1955, highlighting some of the more notable events. We already observed, for instance, that three of the speakers worked at war-related institutions at the time they spoke to our section. At the first meeting held after the U.S. entered the war, the title of the talk by Lehigh’s G. E. Raynor was “Exterior ballistics”. This is the same meeting at which Haskell Curry spoke while assigned to the Frankford Arsenal in North Philadelphia, though his topic was Heaviside operators. Hilda Geiringer, an émigré who was teaching at Bryn Mawr at the time, spoke on numerical solutions of linear problems, but her talk concerned pure rather than applied mathematics.</div>
