</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Donald Ward Western</dfn> (1915-2003) was born in Poland, New York. He obtained a bachelors degree from Denison University in 1937, a masters degree from Michigan State University in 1939, and a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1946 for a dissertation on integral norms written under Paul Rosenbloom and Jacob Tamarkin. Western joined the faculty at Franklin &amp; Marshall College two years after receiving his doctorate, remaining there until he retired in 1980. During that time he served as chair of the department for 20 years, 1952-1972. He was elected to the section’s Executive Committee for a three-year term in 1957, the same year that he was appointed to the committee on high school contests. He was active in the Philadelphia Section in several other ways – serving on the Program Committee 1952-1953, being elected chair for 1961-1962, being elected sectional governor for 1962-1965, and being a panelist at meetings held in 1966 and 1972. Western was an NSF faculty fellow in 1960. He still resides in Lancaster.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-72" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
