<em class="alert">Frederick William Owens</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1880-1961\)</span>) was born in Iowa and received his B.S. degree from the University of Kansas in <span class="process-math">\(1902\text{.}\)</span> He continued graduate studies at Kansas, where he met and married fellow graduate student Helen Barten Brewster (<span class="process-math">\(1881-1968\)</span>). Both Frederick and Helen Owens then enrolled in the graduate program at the University of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. degree in <span class="process-math">\(1907\)</span> under the estimable E. H. Moore. Then he accepted an instructorship at Cornell University, where Helen B. Owens continued her graduate studies, obtaining a Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1910\)</span> under the department chairman, Virgil Snyder. In <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> the couple moved to Penn State, where Frederick became head of the department, a position he held until his retirement in <span class="process-math">\(1949\text{.}\)</span> Although he was unable to attend the organizational meeting of the section in <span class="process-math">\(1926\text{,}\)</span> held just a few months after he moved to State College, he did travel to Philadelphia for the second meeting and was rewarded with election as the section’s second chairman. Not only did Helen Owens accompany him to that meeting, but there is no record of the either one of them ever attending a meeting without the other. Helen herself had two careers, one as a suffragette (fighting for women’s rights in both New York and Kansas), and, later, as a mathematician (she was an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> and taught at Penn State <span class="process-math">\(1941-1949\)</span>). When she died in 1968 she had been an <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-132-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> member for <span class="process-math">\(49\)</span> years.</div></li>

<em class="alert">Albert Harris Wilson</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1872-1958\)</span>) was born in Tennessee. After receiving a B.S. degree in <span class="process-math">\(1892\)</span> from Vanderbilt University, A. H. Wilson spent the next three years in the graduate program at Johns Hopkins University.  During the first academic year, <span class="process-math">\(1892-1893\text{,}\)</span> he was a Fellow and obtained a masters degree. He left the program two years later, without taking another degree, to accept an instructorship at Princeton University. He left Princeton for the year <span class="process-math">\(1899-1900\)</span> to study in Göttingen. He came to Haverford College as an associate professor in 1910. In the meantime Wilson studied under the renowned Leonard Dickson at the University of Chicago, earning his doctorate in <span class="process-math">\(1911\text{.}\)</span> He remained at Haverford College for the rest of his life, retiring as professor emeritus in <span class="process-math">\(1939\text{.}\)</span> He was a charter member of the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-133-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> when it was formed in <span class="process-math">\(1915\text{.}\)</span> Wilson died in <span class="process-math">\(1958\)</span> at the age of <span class="process-math">\(86\text{.}\)</span>

<em class="alert">John Anthony Miller</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1859-1946\)</span>) was born in Indiana. After graduating from high school there, he taught in the public schools for several years before taking his bachelors degree at Indiana University in <span class="process-math">\(1890\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(30\text{.}\)</span>  One year later he accepted an instructorship at Stanford, which was just opening that year. A famous student in his first class was Herbert Hoover.  Miller took graduate courses at Stanford, resulting in a masters degree in <span class="process-math">\(1893\text{.}\)</span> The following year he returned to Indiana University as professor of mathematics. He seems to have become interested in applications because, after only one year, he switched from mathematics to the department of mechanics and astronomy, where he remained until <span class="process-math">\(1906\text{.}\)</span> In the meantime he enrolled at the University of Chicago. In <span class="process-math">\(1899\text{,}\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(39\text{,}\)</span> he earned his Ph.D. as Heinrich Maschke’s first doctoral student. Seven years later Miller accepted the positions of professor of astronomy and Director of the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore College; he held both for the next <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> years.  When he was elected our section’s fourth chairman in <span class="process-math">\(1929\text{,}\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(70\text{,}\)</span> he not only held two academic positions, he also served as Vice President at Swarthmore (since <span class="process-math">\(1914\)</span>). In that same year Indiana University bestowed an honorary doctorate upon him. Miller’s retirement in <span class="process-math">\(1932\)</span> did not equate to lack of work, as evidenced by the <span class="process-math">\(1935\)</span> publication of the second edition of his book <span class="booktitle">Analytic Mechanics</span>, which appeared initially in <span class="process-math">\(1915\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(1937\)</span> an appreciative group of Swarthmore alumni initiated the Miller Student Loan Fund in his honor.</div></li>

<em class="alert">Tomlinson Fort</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1886-1970\)</span>) was born in Georgia and received two degrees from the University of Georgia, a bachelors in <span class="process-math">\(1906\)</span> and a masters in <span class="process-math">\(1909\text{.}\)</span>  He then enrolled in the graduate program at Harvard University, earning his Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1912\)</span> under Maxime Bôcher. Fort was a faculty member at Lehigh University from 1927 to <span class="process-math">\(1945\text{,}\)</span> serving as Dean of the Graduate School from <span class="process-math">\(1938\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1945\text{.}\)</span> After that he taught at Georgia, South Carolina, Miami (Fla.), and Emory. His election in <span class="process-math">\(1930\)</span> marked the first time a chairman of the Philadelphia Section had come from the Lehigh Valley and undoubtedly explains why the annual meeting returned to Bethlehem the next year after four years in Philadelphia. Fort also served three consecutive terms on the Program Committee from <span class="process-math">\(1928\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\(1931\text{.}\)</span> Later he was elected vice- president of the national <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-134-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>.

Upon graduation he accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until moving to Swarthmore in <span class="process-math">\(1927\text{.}\)</span> When he retired in <span class="process-math">\(1952\text{,}\)</span> his replacement was future EPADEL governor David Rosen.

<em class="alert">John Robert Kline</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1891-1955\)</span>) was arguably the best mathematician among all leaders of the Philadelphia Section during the period of establishment. A <span class="process-math">\(1912\)</span> graduate of Muhlenberg College, Kline earned the distinction of being R. L. Moore’s first doctoral student when he received his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in <span class="process-math">\(1916\text{.}\)</span> Except for brief stints at Yale and the University of Illinois, Kline spent the remainder of his life at Penn, where he supervised <span class="process-math">\(19\)</span> doctoral dissertations from <span class="process-math">\(1925\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1954\text{,}\)</span> including <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-136-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> stalwarts Harry Gehman and Lida Barrett.
