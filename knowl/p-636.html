<div class="para">In <span class="process-math">\(1991\)</span> the MAA announced the initiation of a program of awards for outstanding teaching. Formally called the Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics, each section could elect one winner, and that winner automatically became a nominee for one of at most three annual national awards (except the first year, when seven were awarded). Of course EPADEL participated in this program right away, naming a Selection Committee headed by David Rosen (retired from Swarthmore). The first winner was announced at the 1992 annual spring meeting. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table20.html" title="Table 7.2.2: ">Table 7.2.2</a> lists the winners to date. Initially the award included a framed certificate and a donation to the recipient’s college for the purchase of library materials in the mathematical sciences. Beginning in 1997, however, funding from the Goodville Mutual Casualty Company allocated $500 to the recipient and $500 to the recipient’s library.</div>
