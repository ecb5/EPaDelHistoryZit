<div class="para">During the period <span class="process-math">\(1926-1932\)</span> the Philadelphia Section had <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> different leaders who either held office or served on the Program Committee. Their academic affiliations reflect the geographical diversity of the section. Of the sectionâ€™s three founders, only H. H. Mitchell continued to provide leadership, although he never held another elected office in the section. Bennett moved to Brown University the following year. As we will see, Reynolds continued to participate in sectional activities, even being elected chairman in <span class="process-math">\(1938\text{.}\)</span> However, he never attended a meeting outside the Lehigh Valley area, not even in <span class="process-math">\(1938\text{,}\)</span> though he did ensure that the 1939 meeting, over which he would preside, was held at his home institution of Lehigh.</div>
