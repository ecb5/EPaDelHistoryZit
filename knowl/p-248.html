<div class="para">Unfortunately, Klineâ€™s life was difficult after the 1950 congress. First, his wife Anna died that year at age 59. However, he married Eunice Story Eaton the following year and the two of them went to Germany with much hope for a renewed life. Kline expected to write a book on the Jordan curve theorem, its extensions, and its applications to topology and analysis, but it never materialized. He was beset with administrative problems upon his return to Penn. Combined with personal tragedy and physical ailments, the torture was too much for him to handle, and Kline committee suicide. He was buried in Quakertown after his death on May 2, 1955.</div>
