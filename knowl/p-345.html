<div class="para">The first column of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table11.html" title="Table 5.1.1: ">Table 5.1.1</a> lists the dates of the 14 meetings in this period. It is notable that the Philadelphia Section, unlike many others, was able to hold meetings every year throughout World War II. Even two national MAA meetings were canceled, the 1942 meeting scheduled for New York (“at the request of the Office of Defense Transport”) and the 1945 summer meeting scheduled for Montreal (“by order of the Office of Defense Transport”). Continuing the official policy from 1939, the section held its annual meetings on the Saturday following Thanksgiving.</div>
