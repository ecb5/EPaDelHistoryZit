<dfn class="terminology">Alexander Tartler</dfn> (1905-1985) was born in Budapest, Hungary. He received two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, a bachelors in 1928 and a Ph.D. five years later. Like Delawareâ€™s C. J. Rees, his dissertation was written under J. A. Shohat. After earning his undergraduate degree he joined the faculty at the Drexel Institute of Technology and remained there until 1949, when he moved to Lafayette College. Although Tartler was promoted to full professor and department chairman at Lafayette in 1951, he returned to Drexel the very next year to accept an offer of these same two positions. He retained the chairmanship until 1966 and retired four years later. Tartler was known by his students as a very rigorous instructor whose backboard writings were works of art. Although he drove many engineering students crazy with his precision, this trait inspired several engineering-to-mathematics converts. Tartler died at <span class="process-math">\(B0^{th}\)</span> birthday.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-51" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
