<div class="para">The special session on computers held at Lebanon Valley on April 12, 1975, consisted of three one-hour talks in the morning followed by a bevy of workshops in the afternoon. After the opening remarks by the organizer, Joerg Mayer, the first invited address was delivered by Wallace J. Growney, who had moved to Susquehanna University from the University of Oklahoma a few years earlier. His talk, entitled “Computer underwear”, was described as “an elementary but fast-paced talk on the hardware and software beneath the surface of computing.” Next came another EPADEL member, John A. Beidler (University of Scranton), with the clever title, “The computer, as seen by the computer scientist and by the mathematician”. The final talk at the morning session was “Some views on computer science in small colleges” by R. Austing of the University of Maryland.</div>
