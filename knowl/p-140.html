<div class="para">J. B. Reynolds was born in New Castle, in the western part of Pennsylvania, on May 17, 1881, to Peter Stafford and Lydia Ann (Kemp) Reynolds. He was educated in public schools, graduating from New Castle High School in 1903. Considering his later accomplishments, graduation at age 22 is certainly not due to lack of intelligence; rather it was probably due to the need to work on the family farm. Upon graduation he crossed the state to enroll at Lehigh University, where he earned an A.B. degree four years later. The title of his undergraduate thesis portends an interest in applied mathematics, as well as the inclination of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at the time – “The temperature compensation of the Bond sidereal clock of Sayre Observatory at Lehigh University”.</div>
