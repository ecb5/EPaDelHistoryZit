</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Isaac Edward Block</dfn> is a native Philadelphian who was born in 1924. He received his bachelors degree in physics from Haverford College in 1944. He then obtained two degrees from Harvard, an M.S. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1952, both in mathematics with the latter under the famous analyst Joseph Walsh. Ed Block was a mathematics consultant for Philco Corporation from 1951 to 1954. During this time he was a founder of SIAM; he was elected its first secretary and served as managing editor of its first journal. Subsequently, as a volunteer, he served as chair of the SIAM’s publications committee, and eventually as chair of the SIAM board. In 1954 Block accepted a position with the computer company Burroughs Corporation as manager of its Philadelphia Computer Center. He was employed there when elected chair of the Philadelphia Section three years later. Block later worked at another computer company, Remington Rand Univac - Philadelphia, as manager of its applied mathematics department. Later he became a vice-president of Auerbach Publishers, Inc. In 1976 he was persuaded to become SIAM’s first full-time managing director, a position he held until his retirement in 1994. That same year Block was awarded the MAA’s Certificate of Merit, the only person from our section to receive it during the section’s first 75 years. The Certificate of Merit is a special award given at irregular intervals for some special work or service associated with mathematics or the wider mathematical community. Block still resides in the Philadelphia area.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-69" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
