<dfn class="terminology">Hilda Geiringer</dfn> (1893-1973) was born in Vienna, Austria. She received all of her degrees from the University of Vienna, where she attended lectures from Sigmund Freud and obtained her doctorate in mathematics in 1917 with a thesis on Fourier series in two variables. She worked at the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin until forced to leave when Hitler came to power in 1933. She spent the year 1933-1934 in Brussels, then taught in Istanbul, Turkey, for the next five years. She immigrated to the United States in 1939, teaching at Bryn Mawr College for five years. While there she married the Harvard mathematician Richard von Mises (1883-1953) in 1943. One year later Geiringer-von Mises accepted a position as professor and chair of the mathematics department at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, to be near her husband. She retired from Wheaton in 1959.</div></li></ul></div>
