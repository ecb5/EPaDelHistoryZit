<em class="alert">Morris Samuel Knebelman</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1890-1972\)</span>) was born in Russia. After coming to the U.S., he received a B.S. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1912 and an M.S. from Lehigh University in <span class="process-math">\(1914\text{.}\)</span> During his second year at Lehigh he was appointed an instructor. In <span class="process-math">\(1925\)</span> he enrolled in the graduate program at Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1928\)</span> for a dissertation on differential geometry written under two notable advisors, Oswald Veblen and Luther Eisenhart. Knebelman served as an instructor at Princeton while completing his degree, and he remained there the next year on a National Research Council Fellowship. Due to the sudden death of a faculty member in the summer of <span class="process-math">\(1929\text{,}\)</span> Princeton had the dire need for someone to head the university’s mathematics courses for engineers. Knebelman’s background at Lehigh made him a suitable candidate, so he was offered the position of assistant professor. He continued in this capacity until 1939, when he became a professor and head of the department at Washington State University. He later became Dean of the Graduate School at Washington. Knebelman taught there until <span class="process-math">\(1965\)</span> when, at age <span class="process-math">\(74\text{,}\)</span> he returned east as a visiting professor at Bucknell University. He died in Lewisburg in <span class="process-math">\(1972\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(82\text{.}\)</span></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-8.html#li-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
