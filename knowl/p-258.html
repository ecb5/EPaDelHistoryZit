<div class="para">During this period the section prospered under nine different chairmen, only two of whom had been elected to office during the first seven years, H. H. Mitchell and Arnold Dresden. These nine represent geographical areas within the Philadelphia Section that are more scattered than during the preceding period: H. H. Mitchell and J. A. Shohat were from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, while J. Clawson (Ursinus College), A. Dresden (Swarthmore College), and C. O. Oakley (Haverford College) came from the suburbs. Three chairmen came from the Lehigh Valley: L. L. Smail and J. B. Reynolds from Lehigh University and W. M. Smith from neighboring Lafayette College. The remaining chairman was Richard Morris of Rutgers University. It might be pointed out that by the end of this period no representative from the University of Delaware had yet served as chairman of the section, a situation that would change dramatically in the 1940s.</div>
