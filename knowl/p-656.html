<dfn class="terminology">Annalisa Crannell</dfn> was born to be an academic, having been delivered to a pair of graduate students in physics at the Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto, California. She crossed the country to take her undergraduate education in the EPADEL area, earning a bachelors degree Magna Cum Laude with honors in mathematics from Bryn Mawr at age 20 in 1986. From there Crannell traveled further east to enroll in the graduate program at Brown, where she received a masters degree three years later and a Ph.D. in 1992. Her doctoral dissertation, “The existence of many periodic, nontraveling solutions to the Boussinesq equation”, was written under the supervision of Walter Craig. Crannell went directly to Franklin and Marshall upon receiving her degree and has remained there since then. She will chair the department beginning in 2001. Crannell engaged in professional activities soon after reaching F &amp; M by serving on three national committees – the Joint Committee on Employment Opportunities (1992- 1995), the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-179-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> Committee on the Profession (1995-2000), and the <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-180-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> Short Course Committee (beginning in 2000). In addition she wrote articles, edited a video, and organized panels about finding jobs in mathematics in a tight market. Crannell was elected vice president of EPADEL for 1999- 2001. Starting in 2001 she will become an Associate Editor of <span class="booktitle">Mathematics Magazine</span> and an editor of <span class="booktitle">MAA Notes</span> series.</div></li></ul></div>
