<div class="para">During those five years the section sponsored <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> lectures by <span class="process-math">\(21\)</span> different individuals associated with <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> different colleges. Lehigh paved the way with five speakers, followed by Penn, Penn State, and Princeton with three each, and Swarthmore with two. The affiliations are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table6.html" title="Table 3.5.2: ">TableÂ 3.5.2</a>. The five schools with one speaker each are Brown (Bennett), Bryn Mawr (Lehr), Columbia (Ritt), Lafayette (Smith), and Ursinus (Clawson). Bennett himself might even be regarded as representing Lehigh since he had left there just one year before.</div>
