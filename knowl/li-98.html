<dfn class="terminology">Walter Rees Stromquist</dfn> possesses very strong mathematical genes. His father, Walter Kellogg Stromquist (1917-1999), was a nuclear engineer with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Tennessee. WKS worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory when his son WRS was born. WKS’s uncle, Carl Eben Stromquist (1877-1925), received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale in 1903 and was on the faculty at Princeton 1903-1909. CES then moved to the University of Wyoming, where he remained until ill health forced him to resign in 1922. During this time he was a charter member of the MAA in 1915 and one of the organizing members of the Rocky Mountain Section of the MAA two years later. EPADEL chair Walter Rees Stromquist received his B.A. from the University of Kansas in 1970 before enrolling in the graduate program at Harvard, where he earned two degrees – an M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1975. His dissertation on the four-color problem was written under the supervision of Andrew Gleason. Stromquist did not restrict himself to mathematics during his stay at Harvard, however, electing graduate courses in economics and tax law. Thus it is not particularly surprising that his first professional experience was with the Office of Tax Analysis in the U.S. Treasury, where he worked 1973-1977. In 1979 Stromquist accepted a position with Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, ultimately rising to become vice president of the company before leaving in 1998 to become an independent consultant. During his tenure he was a visiting professor at Temple 1987-1988; he also taught as an adjunct professor at Bryn Mawr, Eastern College (in economics), George Washington, and West Point (as an Army reservist). Stromquist served as a member of the section’s Executive Committee 1987-1991 before being elected to stints as vice president and president. At the national level, Stromquist was elected MAA Governor at Large for Industry and Government in 2000 and served as an associate editor of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> <span class="process-math">\(1996-2001\text{.}\)</span></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#li-98" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
