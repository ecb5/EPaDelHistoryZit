<div class="para">J. R. Kline became a respected member of the international mathematical community, publishing four papers in the Polish journal Fundamenta Mathematicae and three in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Moreover, Kline wrote a joint paper with his advisor, the only publication Moore ever coauthored. Most of Klineâ€™s publications appeared from the time of his dissertation in 1916 to a long paper on separation axioms in topology in 1928. Administrative duties demanded most of his time and attention after that. Nonetheless, he was elected secretary of the International Congress of Mathematicians for the meeting held in 1950 in Cambridge, MA.</div>
