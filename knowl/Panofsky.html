</div></aside>      was raised outside of Philadelphia, PA (specifically in the towns of Bensalem and Holland). She had to switch schools in her very early years and because of inconsistent curricula she learned to add and subtract before she learned to read.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen earned her B.S.Ed. from Millersville University in 2002, her M.S. from Lehigh University in 2004, and her Ph.D. also from Lehigh in 2008. From 2008 to 2012 she was an Assistant Professor at Cabrini College. In 2012 she accepted a tenure track position at Temple University, earning tenure in 2018.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen served on the EPADEL Executive Board as a Member-At-Larg (2011-2017), Vice Chair (2017-2019), and Chair (2019-2021). Her predecessor as both Chair and Vice Chair was her former real analysis professor at Millersville, Ximena Catepillan.</div>
<div class="para">Ellen has the dubious and unsought distinction of being the only Chair/President of the section never to have stood in front of the assembled membership to conduct a meeting.  She became chair just prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and had to make the heartbreaking decision to take the meeting to a virtual format in the spring of 2020. Unfortunately the pandemic coincided almost exactly with Ellenâ€™s time as Chair so she was never able to preside over a physical meeting of the section.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-54.html#Panofsky" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
