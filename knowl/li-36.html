<em class="alert">William Mackey (“Will”) Smith</em> (1881-1966) is a native of Oxford, PA. He received a Ph. B. (Bachelor of Philosophy) degree from Lafayette College in 1903, and joined the faculty of his alma mater two years later as an instructor. However, he left that post for two years to enroll in the graduate program at Columbia University, where he received a Ph.D. in 1911. Smith then returned to Lafayette for a year before accepting an assistant professorship at the University of Oregon. Although promoted to full professor there after only one year, he returned to Lafayette as an associate professor in 1915 and remained at the Easton college for the rest of his life. He was appointed head of the department in 1934, a year after serving as the section’s chair. Like many Americans, Smith’s career was interrupted by World War II, when he served as the Director of War Studies at Lafayette from 1943 through 1945. He died in 1966 at the age of 85.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-21.html#li-36" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
