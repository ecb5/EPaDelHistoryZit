<div class="para">The main part of the program for the 1987 meeting consisted of three lectures and a panel discussion on the theme of actuarial mathematics, with all participants hailing from the EPADEL area. The first speaker was Roy G. Shrum, an actuary and a vice-president of the Pennsylvania National Casualty Insurance Company, who had passed two actuarial examinations while still an undergraduate student at Penn State. Shrum had, in fact, passed all ten exams before delivering his presentation, “A day in the life of an actuary”. The next two speakers represented emerging academic programs at local universities. Bonnie Averbach, the director of the program in Actuarial Science at Temple, spoke about “Life contingencies”. She was followed by Neil Vance, from Penn’s Department of Insurance, a specialist on the use of Fourier analysis in insurance problems, whose lecture was titled “Approximating total claims of a life insurance company”. The panel discussion aimed to answer the question, “How do you prepare to become an actuary?” Moderated by Brian Hearsey, the director of Lebanon Valley’s acclaimed actuarial program, the panel consisted of recent graduates from liberal arts colleges who had pursued careers in actuarial science. While the format of the program at the spring 1987 meeting might have been fairly standard, the day did not end that way. The last item on the agenda treated attendees to a reception at Moravian’s Payne Gallery where they could view an exhibit titled “A mathematician views M. C. Escher,” hosted by our section’s Escher specialist, Doris Schattschneider.</div>
