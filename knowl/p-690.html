<div class="para">EPADEL members delivered two of these talks. In 1984 Temple’s Raymond F. Coughlin, a pioneer in “short calculus” texts, gave a lecture about teaching what then was becoming an increasing problem at many institutions, students ill- prepared for university-level mathematics. The title of Coughlin’s talk, “Remediation: A waste or a gold mine?”, provides no clue to the speaker’s strong feeling that remediation presented a potential lucrative market for universities if they took it seriously. Lafayette’s James Crawford presented a talk about teaching a contrasting set of students. At the 1999 meeting commemorating the 100 th anniversary of Elizabethtown College, Crawford dealt with students who came to college well prepared for calculus courses in a talk titled “Teaching calculus: A personal, institutional, and historical perspective”.</div>
