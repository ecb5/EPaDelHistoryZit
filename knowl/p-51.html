<div class="para">Overall this chapter answers these questions in two ways. First, it describes the efforts of three mathematicians to found the Philadelphia Section in 1926: A.  A. Bennett and J. B. Reynolds from Lehigh University and H. H. Mitchell from the University of Pennsylvania. Each founder is profiled at the end of the chapter.  Their aim was to foster a spirit of collegial mathematics throughout eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware. No organization can thrive with only three leaders, and our section benefited from a large cadre of volunteers. Biographical sketches of some of them are included, as well as brief portraits of most of the section’s <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> charter members. This group formed the critical mass needed to establish and energize the section’s early meetings.</div>
