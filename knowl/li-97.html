<dfn class="terminology">Nancy Lineken Hagelgans</dfn> was born in Burlington, Vermont. She received an A.B. from Goucher College in 1956 before entering the graduate program at Johns Hopkins, earning an M.A. three years later. Hagelgans taught at two Baltimore institutions (Goucher 1967-1968 and Towson State 1967- 1972) before moving to the EPADEL area. While teaching at Haverford from 1975 to 1977 she decided to complete her doctorate at Hopkins. Her supervisor, Jean-Pierre Meyer, suggested that James Stasheff of Temple might act as her advisor. He did, and Hagelgans completed her dissertation on local spaces with three cells as H-spaces in 1977. She spent 1977-1978 at Bryn Mawr, all the while searching for a tenure-track position. Since it seemed that the only openings involved computer science she completed an M.S. in that field at Villanova in 1979. In 1978 Hagelgans landed a tenure- track position at Ursinus in both mathematics and computer science. She has remained there ever since, except for the year 1986-1987 spent as a visiting professor at the University of Delaware. She served as the department chair at Ursinus 1988-1992 and resumed that post in January 2001. Hagelgans was elected to a three-year term on the EPADEL Executive Committee in 1986, when she also began coordinating the Consultants and Speakers Program. In addition to four years as president and vice president, she was elected to a three-year term as governor 1995-1998. She also was an invited speaker at the section’s spring meeting in 1996 on one of her specialties, cooperative learning in discrete mathematics. Along this line, she is one of the authors of the book <span class="booktitle">A Practical Guide to Cooperative Learning in Collegiate Mathematics</span>, published in 1995 as MAA Notes Number 37. Hagelgans has been active in the national MAA in many other ways – serving on the Committee on Consultants (1997-1999), the task force on the MAA publication <span class="booktitle">Guidelines for Programs and Departments in Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences</span> (1997-2000), the Professional Development Committee (1998-2001), and the Committee on Sections (1999-2002). She has also been involved in Project NexT as a mentor since 1995, as a workshop presenter in 1996, and as a panelist in 1998 and 1999.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#li-97" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
