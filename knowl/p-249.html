<div class="para">The Philadelphia Section was established in 1926 to advance the cause of collegiate mathematics in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware. There was no need to define “eastern” or “southern” because no other sections of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-159-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> covered the states of Pennsylvania or New Jersey at the time. However, as Philadelphia Section founder Albert A. Bennett so presciently predicted in 1926, the formation of a section centered at one of the two poles in the Keystone State would spur the establishment of a section centered at the other. That event transpired when the Allegheny Section was founded in 1933, so beginning that year the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-160-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> divided the state of Pennsylvania into two parts defined by longitude <span class="process-math">\(77^\circ\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(30'\)</span>W. This geographical boundary meant that much of central Pennsylvania, including notably Penn State, became aligned with the Pittsburgh axis. Although this arrangement removed from the Philadelphia Section such leading figures as Orrin Frink, Frederick Owens, and Helen Owens, the loss was mitigated by a new wave of energetic, creative leaders.</div>
