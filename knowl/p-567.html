<div class="para">Willâ€™s enthusiasm for and encouragement of young mathematical talent is evidenced by his long and continuing involvement as regional coordinator of the annual American High School Mathematics Examination and as director of the Delaware Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. He has also had a fruitful association with in-service training of teachers of mathematics, and is currently involved in materials development for high schools. His concern for the teaching of service calculus courses, coupled with his interest in mathematical modeling produced a pioneering book, co-authored with Clifford W. Sloyer which combined probability with calculus and was intended for students in the biological and managerial sciences.</div>
