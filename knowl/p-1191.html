<div class="para">Lisa has the distinction of being the last occupant of two positions within EPADEL. While she was serving as Section President in 2008 EPADEL's By Laws were updated and the title was changed to "Chair."  She was also serving as Section Governor when the 2017 MAA By Laws update changed that title to "Section Representative to MAA Congress." Starting in 2018 Lisa has been a member of the MAA's Board of Directors as a consequence of serving as the Chair of the Committee on Sections.                            </div>
