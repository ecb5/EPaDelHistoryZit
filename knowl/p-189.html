<div class="para">At the time of the 1927 meeting the 65-year old Edwin S. Crawley held the distinguished Thomas A. Scott Professorship in Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. On this occasion he reflected on the history of mathematics by sketching the contents of The Geometry, the historic work that was one of three influential appendices to Descartes’ monumental Discourse on Reasoning (1637). Crawley described Descartes’ introduction and use of coordinates in the construction of a normal to a curve. In the sense that the topic was on analytic geometry, the first paper at this meeting was similar to the first paper at the organizational meeting.</div>
