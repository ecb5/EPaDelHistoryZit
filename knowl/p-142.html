<div class="para">Reynolds continued his studies while teaching at Lehigh, earning a masters degree in 1910. Once again he wrote a thesis with an astronomical theme, “The determination of the elements of the orbit of a minor planet: Taunton no. 94, ‘Lehigh’.” In 1928 he was promoted to professor of mathematics and theoretical mechanics. Could his role in the founding of the Philadelphia Section have played a part in the promotion? If it did, it probably was not so important as time spent as Acting Head of the department during 1924-1925.</div>
