<div class="para">Bennett was an inveterate problem solver and problem poser. Many of his contributions were published in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>, beginning with problem #246 in the June 1916 issue, when he was an instructor at Princeton. J. B. Reynolds published the solution to Bennettâ€™s problem #513 in the February 1917 issue of the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span>. Could it be mere coincidence that Reynolds taught at Lehigh? Or that fewer than ten years later the two would combine with H. H. Mitchell to found the Philadelphia Section?</div>
