<div class="para">At the 1993 spring meeting, four lecturers described projects related to the day’s theme, “Improving mathematics learning”. All four talks reflected the change in perspective that was taking place in the mathematics community at the time – from an emphasis on instructors and teaching to an emphasis on students and learning. Two of the presentations described projects developed in classrooms in the EPADEL area. One was a joint presentation by Gerald J. Porter (Penn) and David R. Hill (Temple). Former EPADEL governor Porter began by describing an interactive linear algebra text the two speakers had written; he then related experiences in using it at Penn in what he called “Linear algebra AS a laboratory course”. Former EPADEL president Hill then described a similar course at Temple and contrasted it with Porter’s course. The distinction between the two can seen in the title Hill adopted, “Linear algebra WITH a laboratory course”. The other EPADEL speaker, Nancy Baxter (Dickinson), discussed design and implementation issues that arose when she adopted a lab-based, collaborative, constructivist approach to teaching functions, in her lecture “Teaching mathematics without learning”.</div>
