<div class="para">The issue of industrial mathematics gave way to other applications at the 1961 meeting, when two of the three invited speakers lectured on related topics. Both hailed from New Jersey, which was no longer part of the Philadelphia Section. After the eminent Hans Rademacher began the program with a traditional mathematical talk, A. G. Grace of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), then located across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, NJ, suggested ALGOL 60 as a computer language appropriate for undergraduate mathematics majors. Grace said perceptively, “the dearth of compilers and the lack of suitable educational materials are thought to be vanishing problems.” The well-known mathematician Henry O. Pollak followed him on the program. Pollak, then associated with Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, described the report titled, “Recommendations of the Panel on Physical Science and Engineering, Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics”. The practice of devoting an entire meeting to one specific issue occurred several times in the early 1970s.</div>
