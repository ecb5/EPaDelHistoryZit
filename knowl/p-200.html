<div class="para">Penn State’s Orrin Frink presented talks at the first and last meeting of this five-year period. In 1928 he described a method of obtaining formulas from differential calculus without the use of any limiting process. Frink wrote that his method differed from early writers on the calculus by “being rigorous”; it was, in fact, based on the theory of analytic functions of a hyper-complex variable. One can only wonder what the successful calculus textbook author Lloyd Smail thought of this stinging critique while seated in the audience.</div>
