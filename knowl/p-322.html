<div class="para">In 1937 Albert Harry Wheeler, a high-school teacher from Worcester, Massachusetts, presented a talk titled “Stellated polyhedra, illustrated by models”. In his presentation Wheeler showed by means of paper models some unusual transformations of solids. In addition to paper models he showed photographs of many forms of stellated polyhedra, probably passing the photos among the 57 listeners in the room because overhead projectors were not yet in use.</div>
