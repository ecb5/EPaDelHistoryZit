<div class="para">One amusing incident related to the Executive Committee shows diligence at the national level. It was reported to the MAA that at the 1962 annual meeting Shaylor Wood of Abington Senior High School was elected to the committee. The Executive Director Harry Gehman wrote, “According to our records, Mr. Wood is not a member of the Association and is, therefore, ineligible to hold office. We have, however, invited Mr. Wood to become a member.” Only then did Gehman notice that the name in the report sent by sectional secretary Voris Latshaw differed from the name in his account of the annual meeting. Two days later Gehman sent a letter to J. Shaylor Woodruff that began, “If you receive a letter addressed to Shaylor Wood inviting you to become a member of the Association, please ignore the letter.”</div>
