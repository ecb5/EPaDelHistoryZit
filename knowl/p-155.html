<div class="para">The first column of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/FirstSeven.html" title="Table 3.1.1: ">Table 3.1.1</a> lists the dates of the first seven meetings.  Nowadays the section holds its annual fall meeting in the early part of November, but initially the date was scheduled for the Saturday following Thanksgiving. It was not until the meeting of 1939 that this original tradition was formally enacted, when the assembled members voted to hold meetings “on the Saturday after the official Thanksgiving Day of Pennsylvania.”</div>
