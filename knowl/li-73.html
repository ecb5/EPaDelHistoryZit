</h3> <dfn class="terminology">Charles W. Saalfrank</dfn> is a native Pennsylvanian, born in 1919. He received a B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 and an M.A. from the University of Nevada two years later. He then returned to Penn as an instructor from 1943 to 1947, all the while completing requirements for the doctorate. He was awarded the Ph.D. the next year for a dissertation written under A. D. Wallace, the first of 22 that Wallace directed. Saalfrank taught at Franklin &amp; Marshall during the 1947-1948 academic year but then left for Rutgers University. He remained at Rutgers from 1948 to 1952, and then crossed the Delaware River again to accept a professorship and become chair of the department at Lafayette College, where he spent the rest of his career. Saalfrank was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1962 and 1963. Amazingly, he was chair of the mathematics department for 30 years, 1952-1982. Charlie Saalfrank retired from Lafayette in 1986. Since then, his wife Marie and he have been living in Ormond Beach, Florida.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-35.html#li-73" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
