<div class="para">The program of visiting lecturers has run continuously since it was directed by Jerry King (Lehigh) in 1974. Within two years King produced a list of 20 members who agreed to speak at nearby schools. He was succeeded by Charles G. Denlinger (Millersville). By 1979 the program had a new chairperson, Bruce Babcock (Penn State – York) and a formal name, the Visiting Lecture Program. Three years later there was a new chairperson, Marialuisa McAllister (Moravian), and a slightly expanded name, Visiting Lecturer and Consultant Program. In her call for additional members McAllister wrote that she was looking for volunteers who “have interesting topics or special expertise to share with colleagues within the section (either as a lecturer or as a consultant) and are willing to forgo the usual honoraria.” She noted too that the Program was aimed to complement the national MAA Program of Visiting Lecturers and Consultants on a regional scale. The Newsletter for the annual fall meeting in 1983 is almost entirely taken up with the complete list of speakers in the Program, some 16 in all. Chairpersons who succeeded McAllister (with the year of first mention in the sectional newsletter) are JoAnne Growney of Bloomsburg (1986), Nancy Hagelgans of Ursinus (1987), Growney again (1990), Louise Berard of Wilkes (1992), and Douglas Ensley of Shippensburg (1995). Berard reported 23 members on her list in 1994 and Ensley increased that total to 25 in 1996.</div>
