<dfn class="terminology">Philip Martin Whitman</dfn> (1916-1997) was born in Pittsburgh. He received a bachelors degree from Haverford College in 1937 and a Ph.D. in 1941 under Garrett Birkhoff at Harvard. Whitman spent the next three years at the University of Pennsylvania. Like almost all American mathematicians in the 1940s, World War II interrupted Whitman’s career. During 1944-1946 he was a scientist at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory at the University of California, which explains why his tenure as secretary ended in 1944. After the war Whitman taught at Tufts College for two years before moving to the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University as a mathematician in 1948. In 1961 he left Johns Hopkins to become professor of mathematics and chairman of the department at Rhode Island College. Whitman died in Massachusetts at the age of 80.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Walter Helbig Gottschalk</dfn> (1918-2004) was born in Lynchburg, Virginia.  He took all his higher education at the University of Virginia: B.S. 1939, M.A. 1942, and Ph.D. 1944 (under G. A. Hedlund). He went right from graduate school to the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1963, serving as chairman of the department from 1954 to 1958. Gottschalk spent the academic year 1947-1948 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1963 he accepted a professorship at Wesleyan University, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. An article from the 1999 <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> titled “The Gottschalk-Hedlund Theorem” reflects the enduring influence of the advisor/student pair from their initial investigation 55 years earlier.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Truman Arthur Botts</dfn> was born in 1917 in Florida. He received his B.S.  degree in mathematics and physics from then-tiny Stetson University in Florida in 1938, followed by two degrees from the University of Virginia, a masters in 1940 and a Ph.D. in 1942 (under E. J. McShane). He joined the faculty at the University of Delaware in 1946 but remained only two years before returning to Virginia. It was during his second year at Delaware that he was elected secretary of the section. Although his stint lasted but one year it foreshadowed administrative abilities that surfaced when he left the University of Virginia in 1968 to become Executive Director of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences. Today Botts is retired and living in Arlington, Virginia. He is best known for his book Real Analysis, written with his dissertation supervisor, E. J. (“Jimmy”) McShane, and first published in 1959.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Richard Donald Schafer</dfn> was born in 1918 in Buffalo, New York. He received two degrees from the University of Buffalo (B.A. 1938 and M.A.  1940) and a Ph.D. in 1942 from the University of Chicago (under A. A.  Albert). In 1942 he also married fellow graduate student Alice Turner right after the two of them had earned their degrees. R. D. Schafer was on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania from 1948 to 1953, during which time he was secretary of our section 1951-1953. His wife served on the Program Committee during the year 1952-1953. However, the Schafers left Pennsylvania in 1953 when he became head of the department at the University of Connecticut. He accepted the position of deputy head at MIT in 1959. Although he stepped down as deputy head in 1968, he remained on the faculty until his retirement in 1988. The Schafers reside in Lexington, MA.</div></li>
