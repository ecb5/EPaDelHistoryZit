Ultimately their activity generated the very first <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> section in the eastern United States. Beginning with an application for a charter from the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-12-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, the section was initially called the Philadelphia Section in spite of the fact that its membership ranged throughout eastern and central Pennsylvania, the whole state of Delaware, and southern New Jersey.
