<div class="para">Columbia University’s Joseph Ritt became the section’s first invited speaker from outside the region when he spoke at the 1929 meeting at the University of Pennsylvania. He might have traveled by train, because the commute between New York and Philadelphia was convenient, 30th Street Station lying within easy walking distance of Penn’s Bennett Hall.
