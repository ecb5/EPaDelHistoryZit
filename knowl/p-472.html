<a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a> described the 1954 session on teaching mathematics using television as a prototype for panel discussions. So far this chapter has described panels that were held in 1958 and 1960. Panels became all the rage at annual meetings after that, with one on every program from 1964 to 1970, except 1967 (which had none) and 1970 (which had two). <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Table14.html" title="Table 6.2.1: ">Table 6.2.1</a> lists all panel discussions conducted during the present period.</div>
