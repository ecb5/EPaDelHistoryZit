<div class="para">The MAA was organized in Columbus, Ohio in 1915. There were 450 members present at that meeting. It was decided that anyone joining during that year would be considered as a Charter Member. 1045 individuals and 52 institutions were admitted as Charter Members. There were five sections: Kansas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, and Illinois. I looked at the charter member list. The first two names from this section of the country were Andrew Apple of F and M, and J. A. Bauman of Muhlenberg. I also noticed that the annual dues of MAA were 2 dollars, payable in advance.</div>
