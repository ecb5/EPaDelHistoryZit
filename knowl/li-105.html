<dfn class="terminology">Lewis Carl Leinbach</dfn> is a native of Palmerton, PA, who received his B.A. at Lafayette College in 1962 and an M.S. two years later from the University of Delaware. He then went west for graduate school, earning his Ph.D. in 1967 at the University of Oregon. His dissertation on order properties in Banach algebras was written under Bertram Yood. Carl Leinbach returned to the EPADEL area immediately upon receiving his degree, accepting a position at Gettysburg College. He was a member of the mathematics department at Gettysburg until 2000, when he joined the college’s new computer science department. Leinbach has been one of the most active members of EPADEL over the past 30 years. In addition to serving as governor, he was elected to the Executive Committee, was the SIG chair, and taught EPADEL-sponsored workshops at Messiah College in 1990 and 1996. At the national level, he was a member of the MAA Classroom Resources Committee, the associate editor for software reviews in the <em class="emphasis">College Mathematics Journal</em>, and the editor of an MAA Notes volume on “Calculus as a Laboratory Course”. As a result of these activities, Leinbach was awarded the 2001 MAA Certificate for Meritorious Service for work done in 2000.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-45.html#li-105" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
