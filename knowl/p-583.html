<div class="para">Schattschneider accepted a professorship at Moravian College in 1968 and she has remained at the Bethlehem school ever since, serving two stints as chair of the department, 1971-1974 and 1985-1991. Her initial involvement with the Philadelphia Section came at the annual meeting in 1974 when she presented the film she had produced with the captivating title, “Rotating polyhedral forms: M. C. Escher with a twist”. She was elected vice-chair of the section in each of the next two years (1975-1977) and elected chair the following two years (1977- 1979). She also presented an invited lecture at the 1977 annual meeting titled, “Tiling the plane with pentagons: A perplexing problem”. An excellent speaker, in 1988 she became the first woman to deliver Pi Mu Epsilon’s J. Sutherland Frame Lecture.</div>
