<div class="para">During the period 1933-1941 there was only one invited lecture at the Philadelphia Section that truly fits into the classification of algebra. In the last year of the period Heinrich Brinkmann discussed the relations between the discriminant of a cubic polynomial and its roots, concluding with an elementary proof of a theorem due to Voroni. Since this topic deals with the classical algebra of polynomials, it means that the section had still not heard a talk about any part of the abstract algebra that was developed in the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, even though the acknowledged leader in the field, Emmy Noether, taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1933 until 1935. In fact, the renowned algebraist Nathan Jacobson replaced Noether at Bryn Mawr, but there is no record of his participation in the section either. Edward Kasner of Columbia University gave an invited lecture on a related topic at the annual meeting in 1933. Titled “Polygons and groups,” he extended results from a <span class="process-math">\(1903\)</span> <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> article to bi- point transformations connected with a given polygon.</div>
