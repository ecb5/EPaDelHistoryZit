<div class="para">Very fortunately, the Section has had a wealth of good speakers and it only seems appropriate to name some. In 1929, J.F. Ritt of Columbia talked on “Liouville’s Work.” I note that Ritt’s work has found renewed interest. Computer Algebra (Maxima, and Mathematica to name active computer packages in use today) uses his work. Among other visitors of note were Salomon Bochner of Columbia University, Richard Courant of NYU, who in a talk “Problems of Stability and Instability in Soap Film Experiments” alerted the Section of advances in Calculus of Variations. Marc Kac of Rockefeller Institute, in 1980, presented a memorable paper entitled “Recollections and Reflections on Fifty Years of Probability Theory” We even had speakers from Europe, for example, A.S. Besicovitch of Trinity College, Cambridge University addressed the Section.</div>
