<div class="para">This chapter describes activities in the Philadelphia Section from the time of the organizational meeting in <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> to the annual meeting in <span class="process-math">\(1932\text{.}\)</span> We refer to this as the “period of establishment” because the energy that was initially expended to organize the section in <span class="process-math">\(1926\)</span> was directed over the next six years to establish it as a thriving organization whose continuity and vitality were assured. Over this period, the section benefited from the emergence of a new set of energetic leaders who sustained it well into the 1930s, thus guaranteeing the permanence of its activities and the success of future endeavors. We profile several of the new leaders and describe their sectional activities.</div>
