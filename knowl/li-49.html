<dfn class="terminology">George Emil Raynor</dfn> (1895-1975) was born in San Francisco. He earned his B.A. degree from the University of Washington (Seattle) in 1918 and two degrees from Princeton, a masters in 1920 and a Ph.D. in 1923. A stint in the Army in 1918 prevented him from completing his dissertation sooner. After teaching at two colleges, Raynor accepted a position at Lehigh University in 1931. He remained there for the rest of his life, directing the doctoral dissertation of one student. In 1948 he was selected as the head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy, a position he held until 1960. He retired as professor emeritus in 1964. Raynor was one of only two chairs of the Philadelphia Section to hail from a Lehigh Valley institution during the period 1942-1955.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#li-49" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
