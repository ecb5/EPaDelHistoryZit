<div class="para">Individuals with strong MAA ties delivered five of the remaining ten lectures that carried educational themes. In 1982 Alan C. Tucker, of SUNY at Stony Brook, whose father, Princeton’s Albert W. Tucker, lectured to the section in 1938, 1948, and 1957, described the “Mathematical sciences curricula”. His talk was immediately followed by an EPADEL panel discussion on a related topic, “CUPM recommendations”. Two years later, MAA president-elect Lynn A Steen (St. Olaf) made a plea for “Renewing undergraduate mathematics”. Two years after that, in 1988, Martha Siegel (Towson State) discussed “Freshman mathematics for the modern age”. The sectional newsletter for that meeting carried an MAA advertisement for the position of Executive Director. Thanks to the knowledge and foresight of sectional governor Gerald Porter, the person chosen to fill that position, Marsha Sward, gave her very first presentation to any MAA section at the meeting held the next year at Millersville. In a lecture titled “Everybody counts: From vision to reality”, Sward discussed timely work initiated by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The very next year, Kenneth Hoffman, then Director of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, continued this line of investigation in his lecture, “Mathematics education reform: Our critical role”.</div>
