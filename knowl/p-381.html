<div class="para">Returning to the theme of war-related activities in the section, the 1943 meeting featured an invited talk by one of the section’s three founders, A. A. Bennett of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The topic of Major Bennett’s talk was Euclidian geometry rather than the ballistics research he was involved with on a daily basis. Another speaker, J. B. Rosser from the National Defense Research Committee, chose to talk about a mathematical subject (many-valued logics) instead of a more bellicose topic. The minutes from the 1943 meeting also reflect the war in progress by setting a “tentative” date for the 1944 meeting, which actually was held on the date assigned a year later. Recall that national MAA meetings were cancelled in 1942 and 1945.</div>
