<div class="para">In 1933 Heinrich Brinkmann of Swarthmore College spoke about projective geometry, a topic also discussed by Penn Stateâ€™s Frederick Owens in 1937. Owens presented an expository paper centered around one theorem: the impossibility of constructing three distinct triangles, real or imaginary, for which each triangle is in six-fold perspective with each of the others. Helen Owens spoke before the section two years later. The fact that the Allegheny Section scheduled annual meetings in the spring enabled mathematicians who had formerly been active in our section to continue their formal ties.</div>
