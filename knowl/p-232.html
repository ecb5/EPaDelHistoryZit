<div class="para">The honors program that Dresden designed required students to complete four seminars in mathematics and two seminars in each of two minors. That was the studentâ€™s whole course load during the last two years. External examiners conducted all assessment in honors. That is still the case today. Although parts of the system have been drastically revised, external examiners remain an integral part of the program.</div>
