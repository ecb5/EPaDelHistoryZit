<em class="alert">Albert Eugene Meder, Jr.,</em> was born in <span class="process-math">\(1903\)</span> in New York City, where he attended Columbia University, receiving an A.B. in <span class="process-math">\(1922\)</span> and an A.M. in <span class="process-math">\(1923\text{.}\)</span> He spent <span class="process-math">\(1922-1926\)</span> on Columbia’s faculty before moving to Rutgers University, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty in <span class="process-math">\(1945\text{,}\)</span> which explains why he was referred to as Dean A. E. Meder in subsequent literature. Earlier in his tenure at Rutgers, Meder held two administrative positions at the New Jersey College for Women, Acting Dean <span class="process-math">\(1932-1934\)</span> and Admissions Officer <span class="process-math">\(1933-1934\text{.}\)</span> This helps to explain why the New Jersey College for Women at Rutgers hosted the annual meeting of the Philadelphia Section in <span class="process-math">\(1933\text{.}\)</span> Meder helped found the New Jersey Section in <span class="process-math">\(1956\text{.}\)</span> He was elected that section’s first chairman during the year <span class="process-math">\(1956-1957\text{;}\)</span> he held the position again <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> years later. The report of a panel he chaired at the section’s second meeting, “The education of mathematics teachers”, was published in the <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> in <span class="process-math">\(1959\text{.}\)</span> Meder also served on several <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-138-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> committees. According to a reviewer, his 1967 pamphlet Topics from Inversive Geometry “was apparently designed for high school students ... [but] would be enlightening to many college students.” Today Dean Meder is retired and living in Manchester, Vermont.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-34" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
