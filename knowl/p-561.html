<div class="para">Baxter was elected chair of the Philadelphia Section in 1968 for the first of two consecutive terms. He remained as chair of his department even longer, five years. During that time Baxter served as the section’s governor from 1971 to 1974. He has been one of the most active members of the section, being elected to the Executive Committee in 1967, being a panel member in 1970, accepting an invitation to speak in 1971, serving as secretary-treasurer from 1976 to 1982, and reminiscing about the history of the section at the luncheon held during the annual fall meeting at Delaware in 1990. (The text of Baxter’s address is reproduced in Appendix 2.)</div>
