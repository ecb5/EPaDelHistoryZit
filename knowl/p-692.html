<div class="para">There are three other categories in which numerous invited talks were presented, history (10), computer science (8), and applications (6). This was the very first period in the section’s history when talks dealing with the <dfn class="terminology">history of mathematics</dfn> attracted such widespread interest. Local historians Paul Wolfson (West Chester) and William Dunham (Muhlenberg) accounted for three of the 10. Earlier in this chapter we noted Wolfson’s involvement with European tours covering various aspects of the history of mathematics. A book-review editor for the journal Historia Mathematica, he highlighted one of those aspects in his 1987 talk, “Newton: The calculus, the Principia”. The other local historian, the husband of present Executive Committee member Penelope Dunham of Muhlenberg College, presented two invited lectures during the 1990s. The clever title of his 1992 talk was “Constructing the regular heptadecagon: Ingenuity or just a lucky Gauss?” The topic of Dunham’s 1999 lecture, “Euler’s sums and Euler’s crumbs”, concerned the main theme from one of his best-selling books, <em class="emphasis">Euler: The Master of Us All</em>. (Recall from <a href="WWII.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: WW II and its Aftermath, 1942-1955">Chapter 5</a> that the Koehler family donated a set of Euler’s works to the library at Muhlenberg College.)</div>
