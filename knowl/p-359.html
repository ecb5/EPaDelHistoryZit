<div class="para">Tiny Bryn Mawr College provided two sterling leaders during the perio had 1942-1955, the venerable Anna Wheeler (chair in 1943) and the renowned John Oxtoby (chair in 1955). Their contributions are detailed in profiles at the end of the chapter. The election of Wheeler in 1943 marked the first time a woman was elected chair of the section. The next woman to be so elected was Marguerite Lehr in 1958; she too hailed from Bryn Mawr. The first woman from another school to be elected chair was Doris Schattschneider (Moravian College) in 1977. No woman was chosen to head the section during the 1980s, but conditions changed dramatically in the next decade when three women were elected to two one-year terms: Nancy Hagelgans (Ursinus College), 1991-1993; Louise Berard (Wilkes College), 1995-1997; and Kay Somers (Moravian College), 1997-1999.</div>
