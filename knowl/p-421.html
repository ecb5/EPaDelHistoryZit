<div class="para">A prevailing folklore asserts that the launching of Sputnik in 1957 not only began the space age but also launched mathematics education in the United States into the 20 th century. Activities in our section throughout the decade prior to the Russian launch belie that assertion. Indeed, activities at our section’s annual meetings show that American mathematical educators were quite concerned about the status of their offerings and were in the process of making changes even before the historic lift-off. In addition to the series on television the section sponsored six other lectures that dealt with high school and college curricula. In 1947 F. D. Murnaghan strongly advocated the use of vector methods in teaching trigonometry and analytic geometry. The meeting four years later included two talks that dealt with educational issues, “The stimulation of interest” by R.C. Yates and “Articulation of secondary and college mathematics” by P. J. Kiernan. As noted above, Yates described topics that stimulated interest in mathematics courses taken during the first two years of college, including “linkages, cams, paper folding” and more. The prep-school teacher Kiernan noted, “Aside from the curriculum, the major point brought up was that of reading ... the college teacher must continue the training of the student in the intensive type of reading that mathematics requires”. Kiernan reported that the issue arose from a panel discussion conducted under the auspices of the New Jersey Committee on the Articulation of Colleges and Secondary Schools.</div>
