<div class="para">Like the 1987 spring meeting, the 1989 version, whose theme was “Computer algebra systems”, consisted of three invited lectures and a panel discussion, this one devoted to “An introduction to computer algebra systems and their use in undergraduate mathematics education”. In the first talk, “Computer algebra using the HP28S,” John Kenelly described his department’s use of Hewlett Packard hand-held calculators, emphasizing the fact that these very powerful calculators placed symbolic calculation in the palms of his Clemson students. Next, Paul Zorn (St. Olaf) emphasized mathematical content and pedagogy rather than technical matters in his lecture titled, “Mathematica in undergraduate mathematics”. Zorn stated, “Although it seems obvious that computing should be a powerful force for change, so far that force has proved eminently resistible. Elementary calculus courses, for example, have hardly changed after 20 years of experiments with numerical computing. Symbolic computer systems, such as Mathematica, will be harder to ignore.” The purpose of the day’s remaining talk, “Computer algebra systems: Issues and inquiries,” by Warren Page (NY City Technical College) was “to initiate dialog and raise awareness of the many critical issues related to the introduction of CASs into the mathematics curriculum.”</div>
