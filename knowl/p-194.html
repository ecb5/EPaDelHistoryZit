<div class="para">Dresden gave a brief report on a method recently developed by W. E. Roth at the University of Wisconsin for determining solutions of the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(P(X) = A\)</span> which are expressible as polynomials in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P(\lambda)\)</span> is a polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> without a constant term, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a given matrix of order <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is the unknown matrix of order <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The fact that Dresden based his talk on work done at Wisconsin combined with Fortâ€™s emphasis on contributions made by American mathematicians reflects a heartfelt pride in achievements by their fellow countrymen.</div>
