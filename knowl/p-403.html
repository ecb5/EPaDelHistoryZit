<div class="para">Three lectures in this period dealt with numerical analysis. In the first one, delivered in 1942 and titled “On modern methods in the numerical solution of linear problems,” Hilda Geiringer took a classical approach to solving systems of linear equations. Such was not the case with Herman Goldstine’s two lectures, which reflected the nascent stage of the computer revolution. In 1949 his lecture, titled “Some problems in numerical analysis,” described one of the four major sources of errors that occur in numerical computations – rounding errors – which arise from the “noise” in the computing machine itself. This theme was continued in his talk five years later on numerical stability. At the conclusion of the lecture that completed the 1954 meeting at Princeton, Goldstine was able to demonstrate his results on the computer at the Institute for Advanced Study. This must have been a real treat for the audience!</div>
