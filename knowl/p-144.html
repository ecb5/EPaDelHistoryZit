<div class="para">The <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> accounted for almost all of Reynolds’ publications, with roughly 90 of the 100 entries appearing in its Problems Department. His first endeavor with the journal occurred when he proposed two problems for solution in the May 1915 issue, one on calculus and one in mechanics. In the remainder of that year he was credited with solving three problems; his solution to a problem on mechanics posed by <span class="booktitle">Monthly</span> founder B. F. Finkel was published as the most elegant of the correct solutions received. The following year Reynolds proposed three other problems and solved one more. But 1917 was a banner year for submissions to the Problems Department, as he was cited for 19 items – five posed problems, three solutions to problems posed earlier, four printed solutions, and seven solutions listed under “also solved by”. His last solution appeared in 1965, exactly 50 years after his first one. He was 84 years old at the time!</div>
