<em class="alert">Echo Dolores Pepper</em> (<span class="process-math">\(1897-1979\)</span>) was born, raised, and mostly educated in the Pacific Northwest. We do not know the origin of her most unusual first name. Hailing from Spokane, Washington, Echo Pepper received her B.S. degree in 1920 and her M.S. two years later from the University of Washington in Seattle. She entered the graduate program at the University of Chicago in <span class="process-math">\(1923\)</span> and obtained her Ph.D. two years later under the eminent algebraist Leonard Dickson. After spending a year at Oxford University on a National Research Council fellowship, Pepper accepted an instructorship in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, a position she held for only two years.  Even though she attended national <a class="external" href="https://www.ams.org" target="_blank">AMS</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-67-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>- <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-68-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> meetings, she never joined either of these organizations, preferring the AAAS instead. In <span class="process-math">\(1928\)</span> Pepper moved to the University of Illinois, where she stayed until becoming the department head at Notre Dame University in <span class="process-math">\(1965\text{.}\)</span> She retired from that position in <span class="process-math">\(1970\text{.}\)</span>

<em class="alert">Kenneth Worcester Lamson</em> was born in Vermont in <span class="process-math">\(1885\text{.}\)</span> He obtained an A.B. from Harvard in <span class="process-math">\(1906\)</span> at age <span class="process-math">\(21\text{.}\)</span> Lamson played the string bass in college. When he was playing gigs with a band, he would put his physics books on the music stand and study while plucking away subconsciously at the instrument. Five years later he was appointed an instructor at South Dakota College (now the University of South Dakota). He then enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was situated when he became a charter member of the <a class="external" href="https://www.maa.org" target="_blank">MAA</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-69-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> in <span class="process-math">\(1915\text{.}\)</span> He obtained his Ph.D. in <span class="process-math">\(1917\)</span> under Gilbert Bliss for a dissertation on the calculus of variations, which was published in the American Journal of Mathematics three years later. Upon graduation Lamson accepted an assistant professorship at Columbia University, where he remained through the summer of <span class="process-math">\(1926\text{.}\)</span> He then moved to Lehigh University, which brought him to the area the same fall that the Philadelphia Section was founded. Three years later he presented an invited lecture at the section’s annual meeting. Lamson spent the rest of his career at Lehigh, retiring in <span class="process-math">\(1951\)</span> as emeritus associate professor. He then taught in Puerto Rico for three years before returning to teach part-time at Lehigh.</div></li>
